0,Venom: The Last Dance Says No to Your MCU Hopes and Dreams,"Warning: Full spoilers follow for Venom: The Last Dance .

The eternal irony of the Sony Marvel movies – a.k.a. Sony's Spider-Man Universe – is that in a Hollywood where interconnected superhero worlds are a dominant force, the Spidey spin-offs that make up Sony’s slate really have very little to do with one another. And while most of those films have bigger problems beyond how they do or don’t connect to one another, in the case of the Venom trilogy – the, I suppose, crown jewel of the SSMU? – the lack of connective tissue to Spider-Man’s world has always been glaring.

The new and apparently final film in the Venom trilogy, Venom: The Last Dance , doubles-down on the “no Spider-Man” stance. And while there are many possible reasons why there’s never been a Tom Hardy/Tom Holland Venom/Spidey crossover – ranging from creative decisions to legal or contractual ones to maybe even the politics of the relationship between Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios and Sony – the funny thing is, the previous Venom movie and the previous Spider-Man movie each seemed to finally be setting up a connection between the two universes. But that set-up is just hand-waved away in The Last Dance as if to say, “Oh, you fans thought we were gearing up for something big? Nahhhh.”

2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage featured a post-credits scene where Hardy’s Eddie Brock/Venom was somehow seemingly transported to the MCU. Once there, the bonded pair see on TV that J. Jonah Jameson has revealed Peter Parker’s identity to the world (from the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home ), and Venom licks the screen right where Spidey’s face is, saying “that guy.” The symbiote was clearly very interested in Peter for some strange reason.

Seemed like Sony setting up a face-off to me!

Venom even makes a crack about being sick of the multiverse.

Two months later, Spider-Man: No Way Home was released, and in that film’s post-credits scene we saw Eddie/Venom’s very brief trip to the MCU already come to an end. Following directly on the Let There Be Carnage scene, Eddie/Venom is sitting in a bar talking to a bartender (Ted Lasso’s Cristo Fernández) about all the “super people” who live in this universe. “Maybe I should go to New York and speak to this Spider-Man,” he says, before suddenly being magically transported away… but not before leaving the smallest bit of Venom symbiote on the bar.

And that seemed like Marvel Studios getting Hardy out of the MCU as fast as they could.

It was also the last time we saw Eddie/Venom before The Last Dance, and in fact, they’re still in the MCU at the start of the new film. The above bar scene is even replayed for us, but it’s a condensed version that’s missing some important bits. While the “purple alien who loves stones” is still mentioned in The Last Dance, the other “super people” talk is not, and most notably there’s no mention of… Spider-Man. The line about Eddie/Venom going to New York to find the wallcrawler is also gone. (Venom even makes a crack about being sick of the multiverse before they depart.)

The funny thing is, The Last Dance does feature a recurring thread about Hardy’s character(s) wanting to get to New York. Only now it’s not to find Spidey, but rather because the symbiote has always wanted to see the Statue of Liberty. One can almost see an earlier draft of the script being about the pair trying to get to Manhattan to find Spider-Man, as was previously set up in not one but two different post-credits scenes, but then the decision being made that, “Eh, we’re going in a different direction.” And who doesn’t want to see Lady Liberty in person, anyway?

Fernández’s bartender turns out to have a Venom universe counterpart (you can tell them apart because the Venom world’s guy has long hair!). And indeed, he figures in The Last Dance’s post-credits scene , though it’s unclear what that will really add up to, if anything. Earlier in the film, Eddie/Venom left a small part of the symbiote in the bar, just as they had in the MCU. So perhaps that will lead to some new take on Venom for Sony? But what about the bit of symbiote left behind in the MCU? At the rate that Marvel has ignored post-credits scene revelations in recent years, I wouldn’t be surprised if we just never hear about it again.

My colleague Tom Jorgensen (who reviewed Venom: The Last Dance for IGN) pointed out that it would’ve been cool for Eddie to finally make it to New York at the end of the film, only to see the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man swinging across the skyline. Fans have long speculated that the Hardy Venom movies are set in that world. So even if Tom Hardy never made another appearance as Venom, that could’ve been an interesting way to close out his story. His Venom never met Spider-Man, but Spider-Man does exist there after all.

But instead, it just feels like Sony has closed the door on the MCU after teasing what could’ve been.",2024-10-26 00:55:33+00:00,Scott Collura
1,"We Build the 2024 LEGO Advent Calendars for Star Wars, Spider-Man, and Harry Potter","Today, we're taking a look at three of LEGO's annual Advent calendars for 2024: Star Wars, Spider-Man, and Harry Potter. This is the third year we're doing this; you can see our 2023 Advent reviews here and our 2022 Advent reviews here .

So good news first: this is the first year that I did not open the box the wrong way. For the past two years, I thought that the Advent calendar was inside the box, only to realize that the Advent calendar is the box itself.

Instead of opening the box from its top or bottom, you detach a cardboard flap, laid across the box's front, to reveal 24 small compartments, concealed with perforated ""doors."" Each compartment is numbered randomly between 1 and 24, to correspond to the days leading up to Christmas.

As a non-Christian (who married a Catholic), I only learned what Advent calendars were a few years ago. To wit: Advent is the preparation season prior to Christmas, and Advent calendars are a fun Christmas Day countdown. You open up one numbered door per day (Door 1 on December 1, Door 2 on December 2, and so forth). Each compartment contains an individual miniature LEGO build.

Sometimes, it's a minifigure, usually with a holiday sweater or some other Christmas apparel. Other times, it's a piece of holiday iconography, like a Christmas tree or a fireplace with stockings. The rest of the time, it's something that's thematically related, while not explicitly holiday-themed. For example: there's a miniature Millennium Falcon in the 2024 Star Wars calendar. There's been a miniature Millennium Falcon in every LEGO Star Wars Advent calendar, come to think of it.

The Star Wars calendar is the least holiday-themed, aside from Luke and Leia dressed in Christmas sweaters. But the collection of space vehicles is very diverse and fun, and includes an X-wing, a TIE Fighter, an AT-AT, a Y-wing, the Razor Crest, the Crimson Firehawk, and a Venator-Class Republic Attack Cruiser.

Earlier this year, I built a massive, 3,942-piece LEGO recreation of Jabba's Sail Barge. For the LEGO Star Wars 2024 Advent calendar, I built a miniature version of the barge with less than 20 pieces. Both barges are impressive, in different ways – the former for its grandeur and attention to detail, the latter for communicating a great deal with very little. (See our picks for the best LEGO Star Wars sets).

The Spider-Man calendar is a little more scattershot in terms of individual quality, and it has the lowest piece count, collectively. But it has some exceptional builds that really stand out. Venom holding a hot dog, wearing a Christmas scarf, is oddly cute. And then the following day, you build the hot dog cart. A lot of the builds in the Spider-Man calendar work that way; you build a minifigure, and then you build the accessory that pairs with it. You build Green Goblin, and then you build his Christmas-themed glider. You build Spider-Gwen, and then you build the drum set for her to play on. (See our picks for the best LEGO Marvel sets).

The Harry Potter calendar is similar to last year's – lots of holiday trimmings like a big turkey, a Christmas tree, and holiday decorations – and a handful of Hogwarts-specific builds. You build four stone busts, representing the four animals for each of the houses. You build four miniature house tables, color coded and laden with food.

And you build seven minifigures, the most of the three calendars that we reviewed: Harry Potter, Susan Bones, Cho Chang, Draco Malfoy, Albus Dumbledore, Professor Flitwick, and the Choir Ghost. The Choir ghost is exceptionally well-detailed, with a deathly pallor and a massive bustle gown. (See our picks for the best LEGO Harry Potter sets).

The builds are simple enough that the instructions exist as a single image, on the inside of each perforated flap. And that is also the most impressive thing about them – that with no more than a few well-placed bricks, the LEGO designers can hint at something much grander. It's a different way of thinking about LEGO that most builders don't even consider. We tend to think about LEGO bricks in bulk – as hundreds of disassociated bits that only create something when they are combined and layered on top of one another.

Certainly, that's impressive. But there's something charmingly childish and affirming about this other type of 'impressive' – that respects and recognizes the power of a single brick to tell a story. It's a hell of a lot cheaper too.

LEGO Star Wars 2024 Advent Calendar, Set #75395, is composed of 368 pieces. LEGO Spider-Man 2024 Advent Calendar, Set #76293, is composed of 246 pieces. LEGO Harry Potter 2024 Advent Calendar, Set #76438, is composed of 301 pieces. All three Advent calendars retail for $44.99 apiece. They're available now.

3,It’s Time to Recognize The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3’s Low-Key MVP: Grog,"This article contains spoilers for The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3.

Many of my discussions with the cast of The Legend of Vox Machina have had to be spoiler-free because they take place prior to their respective seasons releasing, which means, due to how relatively straight-forward his character is, we can never really talk about Grog!

Well, that all changed at this year’s Fantastic Fest, where I locked (invited) some of the cast of Vox Machina (Travis Willingham, Marisha Ray, and Liam O’Brien) in a room and interrogated (interviewed) them about their indiscretions (Season 3). Because we had the opportunity to talk about full series spoilers for the first time, we were able to chat about how Willingham's character, Grog, ended up as Season 3’s low-key MVP.

“You know, it's hard being the brains of the group,” Willingham jokes. Because, you see, Grog has always been a tank, but Season 3 sees him solving Vox Machina’ problems multiple times by simply not overcomplicating things in the way the rest of the team would. “I think a lot of it is just watching a simpleton's approach to some of these things,” he says.

“Grog, he's still and always has been one of my favorite characters because even though, yes, there is a simplicity to the way he thinks, it's often not wrong,” Ray agrees. “There's a very clear straight line, and I think he has an intuition there and I feel like he's used to cut through the bullshit.”

“The other characters overthink things and are overwrought sometimes, and he has a child's wisdom that we all lose in time,” O’Brien adds. In Season 3, his sentiment couldn’t be more true. Every member of Vox Machina is overcomplicating this, that, or the other thing while they navigate difficult family scenarios, a loss of faith, or relationship scaries. But Grog? Willingham notes that he’s usually just thinking about “sandwiches or boobs or anything [that] just happens to be going through his simple mind.”

There was an extra layer of specialness to the first moment we see Grog come through with a solution early on in the season. When they’re trying to find Percy (before all of that upsetting death business later in the season), the barbarian gets down in the dirt with some kids playing with make-believe guns and asks them if they’ve ever seen something like that in real life. Their answer ultimately leads them to Percy, but it was what happened behind the scenes that tugged on Willingham’s heart strings.

“My son Ronan, he's one of the little kids in the street, so that was fun to record as well,” he says. “A father and son doing a little scene that he probably won't remember at all, but we'll always be able to hold it up.”

Both Willingham’s behind the scenes soft-spot and Grog’s ability to cut through the noise to stumble upon solutions are great reminders for all of us to take a deep breath and remember the simple, little things in life. More often than not, that “simple” is where the answer lives. We’re all just stumbling over ourselves and getting caught up in the complex.",2024-10-24 17:32:14+00:00,Amelia Emberwing
4,Why The Legend of Vox Machina Can’t Use Resurrection the Same Way the Critical Role Campaign Did,"This article contains spoilers for The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3.

In Dungeons & Dragons, death is a frequent event — especially on long-running campaigns. The same is true for Critical Role’s original Vox Machina story, which features every single one of the adventurers dying multiple times. Death and resurrection is simply a fact of the game, built into the very mechanics of the gameplay (because dice are fickle jerks). But when it came to adapting the story for television, some fundamental changes to the mechanics of death had to be made, and who died and when became all the more important.

Fans were in for a real blow when Percy died earlier in Season 3, but the biggest shock was when he didn’t get back up. Knowing how often everyone’s died sends viewers in with some armor, and the expectation that when they go down, they’ll probably get back up again. It’s for that reason that Percy had to stay in the ground for a few episodes.

I sat down with some of the Critical Role team — Marisha Ray, Travis Willingham and Liam O’Brien — at this year’s Fantastic Fest to get the details on those changes, and what made Percy’s new arc so important.

“We deal with death at different points in the three seasons we have, and it was Percy's turn, and we thought it would be good to put him down and keep him down,” says O’Brien.

Willingham agreed, adding “I think the literal conversation was, ‘So Percy's going to die. What if he stayed dead for a while.’ And every head turned. We're like, ‘What does that mean? What does that mean? For how long?’ And so we tried to make the end of the seventh episode hit as hard as it could.”

Well it did, sir. It did.

A few people that saw it for the first time and just literally went, 'What?!'

Like most fans, I cried along with Vex (Laura Bailey) while she dealt with the loss the man she couldn’t say “I love you” back to yet. But also like most fans, there was no doubt in my mind that they’d find a way to solve the death just like they had with Vex back in Season 2. But when they put Percy’s body in the ground, the reality of that not being the case started to set in. What if they didn’t bring him back? We knew that they’d be changing the story with the animated series, but what we didn’t know was how far they’d be willing to go.

And Willingham and company were hoping for exactly that reaction when Percy wasn’t magically back up on his feet.

“Instead, it opens on a sun tree with lanterns on it and a funeral procession,” he says “And we had a few people that saw it for the first time and just literally went, ‘What?!’ So that's what we want. And we're also going to be looking for opportunities just for the people that think they know what's coming next. We want to make you guess a little. Maybe we'll deviate even further from here; we might've lost our mind.”

The cleverness in burying Percy goes a step further, too. “It was set up pretty beautifully from Season 2 when Vex dies and it's Kashaw that is the one [to resurrect her],” Ray says. “He says very plainly, ‘Resurrection rites are hard and rare and I've never done one before.’ And then the one guy that Vox Machina knows that can kind of do it gets squishied.”

Kash is lost in the battle with Thordak and his spawn. It is abrupt, devastating, and played out exactly as it was meant to. He’s the type of side character that fans know enough to love, but not think about a ton when he’s not on screen. His death ended up being exactly what was needed for the final punch of the last episodes.

“He's so charming and lovable, and we kept asking ourselves in these big conflicts, ‘Where can we find a moment where the flash of instant change can have effect?’” Willingham says. “Where you're fighting dragons, there are titanic things happening, it can happen just that quickly.”

His death comes and goes in a flash, serving as what seems in the moment to be not just the final nail in Percy’s literal coffin but also a reminder that any one of our heroes could simply get squishied at any time.

No other main party member dies in Season 3, but that doesn’t mean everyone walks out of it safely. Vax (O’Brien) makes a great sacrifice for Vex and his friends, resurrecting Percy against the Matron of Death’s wishes. He was warned that there would be a price to pay for toying with death, and it seems that price will be one of his greatest nightmares becoming a reality. Since becoming the Raven Queen’s acolyte, Vax has been plagued by visions of a zombified version of himself, and bringing Percy back to the land of the living seems to have started that rot.

O’Brien’s not worried, though. “Seems like it's going to be fine,” he says. I mean, Vax’s hand’s rotting off, but he’s got another one, right?

After all, Keyleth (Ray) did say that disease is solvable if you know what to do…

See you next season!",2024-10-24 14:13:00+00:00,Amelia Emberwing
5,28 Years Later: Ralph Fiennes Reveals New Plot Details and Says Two Movies Have Been Shot,"Ralph Fiennes has seeming revealed new details about 28 Years Later, the sequel to the zombie apocalypse classic set to release in 2025.

In an interview with IndieWire, Fiennes talk about his role in the Danny Boye's revival, where he will apparently play a good doctor (as opposed to an evil doctor, which definitely exists in the 28 Days universe). He goes on to reiterate that the revival will be a trilogy, mentioning that ""two have been shot."" Fiennes then shares new details about 28 Years Later's plot.

Ralph Fiennes will play a benevolent doctor in 28 Years later. Photo by Daniele Venturelli/WireImage.

""Britain is 28 years into this terrible plague of infected people who are violent, rabid humans with a few pockets of uninfected communities,"" Fiennes explains. ""And it centers on a young boy who wants to find a doctor to help his dying mother. He leads his mother through this beautiful northern English terrain. But of course, around them hiding in forests and hills and woods are the infected. But he finds a doctor who is a man we might think is going to be weird and odd, but actually is a force for good.”

Fiennes' comments are the firmest 28 Years Later story details revealed so far, with the plot otherwise remaining largely under wraps. The new movie, which will see Boyle return to the director's chair, will once again star Cillian Murphy, where he will be joined by Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Fiennes. The Marvels director Nia DaCosta is reportedly helming the second movie in the trilogy.

First announced in January, 28 Years Later picks up the story of 28 Days Later (2002) and 28 Weeks Later (2007), a pair of post-apocalyptic zombie films set in and around London in which humans have been infected by a so-called Rage Virus akin to rabies. The original movie is considered a seminal part of the zombie canon and one of the greatest horror movies ever made.

28 Years Later is set to release on June 20, 2025, with its follow-up, 28 Years Later II: The Bone Temple, to follow at a later date.

6,Video Game History Foundation 'Disappointed' in DMCA Decision That Won't Grant Exemptions for Researchers,"The US Copyright Office has declined to grant a new exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that would allow libraries and archives to offer remote, digital access to out-of-market video games for verified researchers.

The proposed amendment, which we wrote extensively about back in May, was championed by the Software Preservation Network (SPN) as critical for game preservation. The group argues that due to equipment, technological, and supply limitations, the lack of digital availability of out-of-market games is a massive hindrance to researchers and academics, who may not live near a library that has a physical copy of a needed game available to check out.

However, groups such as the ESA opposed the amendment, claiming it would harm company's ability to make money off of retro games. In fact, one ESA lawyer argued that there was ""[no] combination of limitations [ESA members] would support to provide remote access."" In May, we reached out to every member of the ESA for comment on this matter, but only received one response back.

In the end, the Copyright Office sided with the ESA, stating that the SPN ""did not show that removing the singleuser limitation for preserved computer programs or permitting off-premises access to video games are likely to be noninfringing."" That doesn't mean the exemption is dead - there will be an opportunity to try again in three years, and the Copyright Office's response does seem to invite them to do so: ""She recommends clarifying the single copy restriction language to reflect that preservation institutions can allow a copy of a computer program to be accessed by as many individuals as there are circumvented copies legally owned. This clarifying text will address the perceived ambiguity in the current exemption, while maintaining the single-user limitation’s intended purpose to minimize the risk of substitutional uses of preserved computer programs.""

We're not done fighting here.

And in fact The Video Game History Foundation, which worked together with the SPN on the proposed amendment, has issued a statement expressing pride in the work advocacy groups did throughout the process, and indicating it's not giving up.

We’re not done fighting here. We will continue our advocacy for greater access and legal allowances for video game preservation and working with members of the game industry to increase internal awareness around these issues.

We encourage members of the game industry who are disappointed by the Copyright Office’s decision to ask their leadership to push for greater support for the work of libraries and archives within their industry groups.

The Video Game History Foundation published a study last year revealing that only 13% of classic video games published in the US are currently in release. 87% are currently unavailable.

7,"Sonic x Shadow Generations Sells 1 Million Units on Launch Day, Sega Reveals","Sonic x Shadow Generations has already sold one million units, Sega has announced, despite only coming out today, October 25.

Being a souped up remake of 2011's Sonic Generations didn't slow down the Blue Blur on the sales front, with the figure covering worldwide sales on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

Alongside the remake portion comes Shadow Generations, a brand new chunk of gameplay similar to how Super Mario 3D World was enhanced by Bowser's Fury in the Nintendo Switch remake.

""Sonic x Shadow Generations is a title that combines two games: Sonic Generations, where players can enjoy speedrunning various stages with Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, enhanced with new elements, and Shadow Generations, a completely new game featuring the dark hero Shadow racing through dynamic environments,"" the official synopsis reads.

""The story begins as a mysterious creature called the Time Eater creates distortions in time and space, setting off separate adventures for Sonic and Shadow. Players can look forward to a high-speed action-adventure with distinct gameplay experiences and narratives.""

The game has reviewed well critically too. ""Sonic x Shadow Generations takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights with a creative Shadow campaign and an appreciable graphical upgrade,"" IGN said in our 9/10 review.

Sonic x Shadow Generations is the latest hit for Sega; the Atlus-developed RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio also sold one million copies on launch day.

8,"Valve Finally Fixes BLU Scout’s Pants, 17 Years After Team Fortress 2 Came Out,","Valve has finally fixed a problem with Team Fortress 2 that’s been in the game since it launched 17 years ago.

Ever since the influential hero shooter came out on October 10, 2007, the Scout’s pants on the blue side were the wrong color. Now, among patch notes for a recently released Team Fortress 2 update, Valve buried the big news: Scout’s pants are now fixed.

Here’s the rather innocuous line from the patch notes:

Fixed BLU Scout using the incorrect team color pants

In typical Valve fashion, it made the change without explanation or fanfare. No explanation for why it’s taken 17 years to change the color of Scout’s pants, and no reason for why it’s done so only now. Ever mysterious, Valve is.

It’s fair to say the reaction from the Team Fortress 2 community has been a mix of shock and excitement. “They changed a character design 17 years later! What!” X/Twitter user @heavyfortres asked.

THEY MADE BLU SCOUT’S PANTS BLUE



THEY CHANGED A CHARACTER DESIGN 17 YEARS LATER WHAT pic.twitter.com/WFPdYvwYzx— heavy team fortres 2 (@heavyfortres) October 24, 2024

“Honestly I can't believe they did it,” redditor KyleTheWalrus added. “BLU Scout had gray pants and blue belt loops for 17 years, and he has several cosmetics that require the gray pants color to work correctly.

“If they fixed anything, I was sure they would just make the belt loops gray because it's easier. But those crazy bastards took the hard route.

“Now we wait another 17 years for the rest of Scout's pants cosmetics to become the correct shade of blue. Hooray!”

Valve’s relationship with the Team Fortress 2 community has certainly had its ups and downs over the years. The game’s had an awful bot problem for some time, and exacerbated players often call for Valve to do more to clamp down. They’ve also asked for more support and content for Team Fortress 2 from Valve, which, some say, is more focused on its other, more popular games. Team Fortress 2 remains incredibly popular, though, and is among one of Steam’s most played games ahead of the likes of Warframe, Overwatch 2, and Destiny 2.

Last month, Team Fortress 2 players got creative in the fight against the shooter's rampant bot problem by turning a 340,000 signature strong petition into an actual book and delivering it to Valve headquarters.

9,"Secret Second Predator Movie Releasing Before Badlands in 2025, Both Directed by Dan Trachtenberg","A second, heretofore unannounced, Predator movie is in the works for 2025, with 20th Century Studios planning to release it sometime before Predator: Badlands arrives in November.

In a wide-ranging interview with THR packed with new info about its release slate, studio president Steve Asbell revealed that director Dan Trachtenberg directed a second Predator project that may be destined for a streaming release. Asked whether the next Predator movie would get a theatrical release, Asbell said ""yes and no,"" and then explained what he meant.

""Yes, a Predator movie will have a theatrical. I’ll tell you very simply. After Prey became a success, Dan [Trachtenberg] came back and said he didn’t want to do Prey 2. And we’re like, 'What do you want to do?' And he rattled off a bunch of ideas that were really crazy but really cool,"" Asbell says. ""We’ve actually done two of them. Two are coming out next year. One I can’t talk about yet, but the other one is the live-action Predator film with Elle Fanning that just wrapped in New Zealand. That’ll be out theatrically sometime next year."" [Disney recently confirmed Predator: Badlands would release on November 7].

Asbell claims Badlands is ""an absolutely bonkers idea"" and a ""sci-fi thing, but it’s not what everybody thinks it is."" As for the second Predator movie, the studio has ""different plans"" for the project, but Asbell wouldn't say more — only that it would be out before Badlands.

Asbell's comments will leave fans will plenty of questions, like whether 20th Century Studios will ever make a sequel to Prey, which was critically lauded and a fan-favorite. They also leave fans to wonder whether there will be another Aliens vs. Predator movie, especially with the Alien franchise enjoying a renaissance in the wake of Romulus.

""Probably,"" Asbell says, adding, ""It wouldn’t be in the way you think. That’s the thing. Not in the way that it will just be called Alien vs. Predator or anything like the original movies. If we do this, they’ll be organically created out of these two franchises that we’ve continued with characters that we fall in love with and those characters will combine…perhaps. But we haven’t gotten to that point. And we’re not just going to bang it out.""

One way or another, 20th Century Studios is keeping busy, with Asbell talking about plans for the Alien: Romulus sequel, a Master and Commander prequel, the possibility of Speed 3, and more. You can read about all the rest of the biggest movies releasing in 2024 right here.

Could she be saved? Was it possible? For years, rumors have abounded about secret ways to save her and keep her in the party. And now, speedrunners have found a path to keeping her around that may also be a massive time-saver.

Discovered by speedrunners AceZephyr and Kuma and publicized by Luzbel, a new skip allows players to jump from Midgar all the way to Forgotten Capital with Aerith still in the party. Because it skips the part of the game where Aerith leaves the party, she sticks around, and ultimately witnesses her own death at the hands of Sephiroth only to join the battle against Jenova Life moments later.

The biggest skip in FF7 has been found. pic.twitter.com/HXVfrbOJd4— Luzbel / ルズベル (@Luzbel789) October 23, 2024

The actual skip is pretty complex and the kinks are still being worked out. It involves using a Chocobo on the world map to trick the game into letting you walk on the ocean, and then Cloud simply strolls across the water over to Forgotten Capital without doing any of the other stuff required to get there. The cutscene there plays as normal, but the party composition remains what it was before. Kuma's got a tutorial on YouTube here for anyone interested in trying it themselves.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of asterisks on this skip actually working. For one, if you don't use a version of the game that lets you disable encounters, the skip is impossible, because getting into an encounter while walking on the water will softlock the game. And because Aerith isn't supposed to be in the party at this stage, the game also softlocks whenever there's a scene with the party that she shouldn't be involved in.

The community is currently working to try and find ways around this, including one agonizing five-hour effort from AceZephyr using pause buffering to avoid encounters while walking across the water. Hopefully they find one, because if it ever becomes viable it will supposedly save runners around two hours, allowing them to blast through disc one faster than ever.

If this has sparked your interest in Final Fantasy 7 again, you don't need to speedrun the original to enjoy it. Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth are pretty incredible too, and together they cover a sliiiiightly different version of all the story that speedrunners are skipping on ye olde disc one. We gave Final Fantasy 7 Remake an 8/10, and Rebirth got a 9/10. Our reviewer wrote: ""Final Fantasy VII Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long.""

11,Roblox Makes Big Changes to Parental Controls Amid 'Pedophile Hellscape' Report,"Roblox is implementing some major changes to the control it gives parents over their children's accounts following damning reports that its platform was rife with child exploitation and abuse.

In an email sent to parents who manage children accounts on Roblox, which IGN has obtained and which Bloomberg first reported, the company details that it's finally introducing Roblox accounts with parental privileges. Prior to this, Roblox parental controls allowed parents to essentially set a PIN on a child's account that only the parent would know. This unlocks the ability to change settings like what type of content the child can access and set spending limits.

Now, PINs are going away. Instead, parents must create their own separate Roblox accounts and link them to the child account. This gives parents the ability to update parental controls from their own device, as well as access information about the child's time spent in Roblox and friend list.

Additionally, users under the age of 13 will now require a parent's permission to use certain chat features, and users under the age of nine will require parental permission to engage with any Roblox experiences labeled as having ""Moderate"" content maturity ratings.

Here's the email in full:

Dear parent, We’ve been working on a series of important changes that we’ll be making to your child’s account, [NAME], next month. About Roblox accounts with parent privileges Next month, we’re changing the way parents manage their child’s experience on Roblox by introducing Roblox accounts with parent privileges. After linking your account to your child’s, parents can view and update parental controls for their child all from their own device. Parents also get access to insights about their child’s Roblox usage, such as their daily screen time and on-platform friends. Given these changes, starting next month, parents will no longer be able to set a parent PIN, use Account Restrictions, or receive account-related notifications to their parental email. Instead, you will need to use an account with parent privileges. Existing verified parental emails on child accounts will continue to be used for account recovery. Any settings previously set using a parent PIN will not change, but you will need an account with parent privileges to make updates going forward. As always, if users are interested in an added layer of security on their account, you can set up 2-factor authentication. Updated content maturity settings As we shared with the community in July, to help provide parents and users more clarity into the types of content available on Roblox, we’ll soon begin labeling experiences based on the type of content users can expect in an experience, rather than by age. Experience Guidelines will be renamed Content Labels, and you’ll be able to set limits on the type of content accessible to your child through the content maturity setting in parental controls. New default settings for users under the age of 13 As part of Roblox’s commitment to safety, we are also updating certain default settings for our youngest users. Starting next month, users under the age of 13 will need parent permission to access certain chat features. Users under the age of 9 will also need parent permission to access experiences with content maturity “Moderate,” which may contain things like moderate violence or moderate crude humor. Your child’s settings will be updated when they reach certain ages, if you and your child haven’t previously made changes to them. You and your child will be notified of these updates in advance. We will share more information on these setting updates when the changes go into effect next month. Next steps To continue receiving notifications about your child’s account related to spending or other important activity, you’ll need to set up a Roblox account with parent privileges and link to your child’s account. When these changes take effect, your child will receive a notification inviting them to add a linked parent account, and we’ll send you an email with instructions. Since day one, Roblox has been committed to building safety features and tools into the design of our products. We will always continue to explore different ways to update our parental controls to make them even more useful for parents. Roblox

Roblox's changes come on the heels both of a damning Bloomberg report this summer about the prevalence of child predators on the platform and, just this week, a report from investment firm Hindenburg Research that accused the company of, among other things, being a haven for groomers and pedophiles due to a lack of up-front screening of new accounts. It claimed to have found open trading of child pornography on the site as well as violent and hateful speech and sexually explicit content in numerous games marketed to kids on the platform. Roblox responded, saying that ""safety and civility"" have been ""foundational"" to Roblox since its inception. However, Hindenburg followed up by pointing out that it had not addressed allegations of Roblox being a ""pedophile hellscape.""

Roblox's response is an abject failure to address the two core allegations in our report, including:



1. Evidence that Roblox has been systematically lying for years about the number of people on its platform and their genuine level of engagement.



2. That the platform is a… pic.twitter.com/Tj2KiANOnI— Hindenburg Research (@HindenburgRes) October 8, 2024

And this is far from the first time Roblox has been accused of fostering an unsafe and exploitative environment for children. Back in 2018, the company faced criticism after a mother reported her seven-year-old daughter's Roblox character was violently sexually assaulted by several other characters. Around the same time, a six-year-old girl was reportedly invited into a ""sex room"" in the game. In 2021, reports were highlighted of users recreating real-world mass shootings in the game, and People Make Games published a report alleging that Roblox's business model exploits child labor. In 2022, a San Francisco lawsuit accused Roblox of enabling the financial and sexual exploitation of a 10-year-old girl. In 2023, it was sued both for allegedly facilitating ""an illegal gambling ecosystem"" and more generally for having lax child safety protocols that allegedly led to financial loss and children's exposure to adult content.

Earlier this year, the platform announced it reported over 13,000 incidents of child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2023, resulting in the arrest of 24 predators who allegedly groomed and abused children on Roblox. This number is up 3,000 from 2022. A Bloomberg report suggested that there remained a number of other abusers on the platform who had managed to evade capture. At the time, Roblox referred to itself as ""one of the safest online environments for our users, particularly the youngest users.""

12,First Look at Adult Bobby in King of Hill Revival Reveals How He's Grown Up to be a Professional Chef,"What appears to be the first ever look at adult Bobby Hill has emerged on social media, in the process revealing how Hank Hill's son grew up to be a professional chef.

An image of a grown-up Bobby, now sporting stubble but otherwise looking much the same as he did as a child, was posted by voice actress Grey DeLisle on their Instagram. DeLisle was seemingly in attendance at a King of the Hill event but didn't offer additional context.

Here's the first look of Adult Bobby for the upcoming Hulu revival of King of the Hill. Posted by Grey Delisle pic.twitter.com/VpxkYSPqlW— Out of Context 20th Century Fox (@OOC20thFox) October 25, 2024

[Update: The original photo has since been removed but it can still be found on various accounts around X/Twitter and other platforms.]

The art includes a description entitled ""About the Chef"" that shares more info along with various winking nods to classic King of the Hill episodes.

Chef Bobby Hill has loved food his whole life. From weeknights around the dinner table eating his mom's ""Spa-Peggy and Meatballs,"" to overindulging in lutefisk at church potlucks, to celebrations with family and friends at Luly's Cafeteria, food and the people it's enjoyed with are the foundation for his best memories. In fact, his career as a robata chef was inspired by his most cherished memory of all—weekends spent grilling with his dad. A self-taught chef and one of the youngest contestants on King of the Grill, Chef Hill believes ""good food can solve any problem."" He draws on the influences of his childhood by combining classic Texas dishes with flavors from around the world. With Robata Chane, Chef Hill hopes to honor the art of Japanese robata and the German heritage of the Texas Hill Country while pushing culinary boundaries through his innovative fusion dishes.

Dedicated King of the Hill fans will recall that the final episode shows Bobby discovering a talent for distinguishing the quality of beef cuts, which allows him to finally bond with Hank. It seems that Bobby has managed to turn that talent into a lucrative career by the time of the revival. The update has been confirmed to include a time jump, with most of the original cast and crew returning outside of late Dale Gribble actor Johnny Hardwick, who was nevertheless able to record a ""couple"" new episodes before his death in 2023.

Actress Pamela Adlon revealed Bobby's status back in May and offered a hint of what to expect in an interview with MovieWeb, “We're in the second season [creating] the reboot, and Bobby is 21. He's a chef in a fusion restaurant in Dallas. And it's been incredible. It's just been really fun. I think it's been freakier for Mike and Greg to think about Bobby going from 12 to being 21 and having a relationship and being a person. But don't we all go through that with our kids and our friends' kids? It is shocking when I see my friends' kids and they're all grown up. And I'm like, ‘Wait a second, what just happened?’ So, it’s just a little bit of a mess.”

The King of the Hill revival is set for a 2025 release on Hulu, joining the latest revival of Futurama. Its release date has not yet been revealed.

13,Spider-Man 4 Officially Has a Summer 2026 Release Date With Destin Daniel Cretton Directing,"Sony Pictures has officially set a date for Spider-Man's next MCU outing, announcing that the film will be out July 24, 2026. As expected it will be helmed by Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton, who was reported to be taking the reins after the Russo brothers took over the next Avengers movie.

Spider-Man is officially coming back. Image source: Marvel Studios.

The new Spider-Man 4 release date figures to make 2026 a huge summer for the MCU, putting it two months after Avengers: Doomsday. It's reminiscent of Spider-Man: Far From Home, which was similarly released shortly after Avengers: Endgame. It's also a busy time for Tom Holland, who is set to star in Christopher Nolan's next movie, which is also releasing in July 2026.

Not much is known about the story save that it figures to pick up from where No Way Home left off. Holland has recently shared a handful of updates, confirming that filming will begin in summer 2025 and that the script ""lit a fire"" under him after he read it with co-star Zendaya, though it still needs some work. Andrew Garfield, for his part, has said he won't star in the new film after his surprise turn in No Way Home.

Thinking about the potential plot, it seems likely that Holland's Spider-Man will have some feelings about Robert Downey Jr's Doctor Doom; after all, Tony Stark is his friend and mentor in the MCU. There are also persistent hints of connections to Sony's own Venom movies. It's not for nothing that Sony Pictures announced the release date for Spider-Man 4 on the day Venom: The Last Dance arrived in theaters.

In the short term, the MCU is focusing on projects like Agatha All Along, which is currently running on Disney Plus, as well as the impending release of Captain America: Brave New World. You can see all of the upcoming Marvel projects right here.

14,Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft Gets a Season 2,"Netflix has renewed its animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft for a second season, just weeks after the first season's debut.

In a blog post, Netflix said that while season one of the show was an ""origin story of sorts"" for Lara Croft, season two will ""advance her character from somewhat of a rookie to her journey to becoming the icon we know today.""

When adventurer Lara Croft discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam to retrieve the precious artifacts. Lara’s thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodges the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine.

Showrunner Tasha Huo added that Season 2 will feature Lara slowly building a team, and also that she may punch a shark.

Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft stars MCU actor Hayley Atwell as Lara Croft, and Atwell will return for Season 2. The eight-episode Season 1 launched on October 10 on Netflix, and follows Lara through events occurring between Shadow of the Tomb Raider and the original Tomb Raider games. Legendary Television and DJ2 Entertainment are producing, and Powerhouse Animation Studios is behind the animation.

While the first season of Tomb Raider was received positively by many, we weren't quite so high on it. In our Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft Season 2 review, we said that it ""isn’t terrible, but it’s well below the high bar set by other animated video game adaptations on Netflix."" Here's hoping Season 2 is able to step it up.

15,World of Warcraft’s $90 Mount Is So Popular the In-Game Auction House Is Selling Out of WoW Tokens,"Blizzard’s World of Warcraft is no stranger to costly in-game cosmetics, but its latest super expensive mount is so popular it’s causing a shortage of WoW Tokens at the in-game auction house.

The mount in question is the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur, which you can see in the screenshot below.

World of Warcraft's $90 Trader’s Gilded Brutosaur Mount. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.

What’s so special about this Brutosaur mount and why does it cost an eye-watering $90? Not only does it come with a 20th Anniversary themed harness encrusted with gems representing World of Warcraft’s expansions, it features a genuinely useful time saver not normally found on mounts. The Brutosaur lets players check the in-game auction house and the mail while riding out and about the world of Azeroth via characters Morten and Killia, who sit alongside the beast.

Fueling the mount’s popularity is Blizzard’s decision to make it only temporarily available for purchase. It plans to pull it from sale on January 6, 2025, so players know they only have a few months before this particular Brutosaur is (potentially) gone forever.

To put the cost of this mount into context, it’s the same price as the deluxe edition of World of Warcraft’s latest expansion, The War Within, or about half a year’s subscription to the long-running MMO.

The mount lets you check the auction house and the mail on the go. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.

There are plenty within and without the World of Warcraft community who are understandably critisizing Blizzard for selling an in-game mount for such an eye-watering price. But some players are insisting the Trader’s Gilded Brutosaur is a bargain at $90, and that’s because its value in WoW Tokens compares favorably to the five million in-game gold people paid for the original version of this mount when it was sold for a limited time back in 2018.

WoW Tokens can be exchanged for Battle.net Balance, not just game time, which means players can indirectly buy anything Blizzard sells for real-world money with in-game gold. Here’s how it works: players can buy a WoW Token from Blizzard for $20 and either keep it for later or put it on the in-game auction house. Another player will (hopefully) buy that token from the auction house for in-game gold, then exchange it for $15 of Battle.net Balance (Blizzard effectively takes a $5 tax from the transaction). Battle.net Balance can then be used to buy anything Blizzard sells for World of Warcraft for real-world money, including $90 mounts such as the Trader’s Gilded Brutosaur.

This method relies on players selling WoW Tokens in the game’s auction house, and right now they’re scarce because so many players are snapping them up to use to buy this mount. Because of that, WoW Tokens are selling out and their price in gold has skyrocketed.

""The auction house's WoW Token right now is out of WoW Token supplies since you need suppliers to supply the demand, and currently skyrocketing given the 3% price cap per 20 minutes,"" redditor arasitar explained. ""WoW Token was 200k on NA. Probably going to go to 400k in a short bit.""

At the time of this article's publication, a WoW Token costs 335,171 gold on U.S. servers. You need six WoW Tokens bought from the auction house to exchange for enough Battle.net Balance to afford this $90 mount (6 x $15), which means, at the current rate, paying just over two million gold. The original Brutosaur cost five million gold.

What does this all tell us? Not much that we didn’t know about the World of Warcraft community, anyway. Mounts have, over the years, proved incredibly popular no matter how much money they cost to buy. The original Brutosaur, released in 2018 alongside the Battle for Azeroth expansion, sold like hot cakes, too. World of Warcraft players love their mounts!

For Blizzard, it’s laughing all the way to the bank. Or, as redditor Chuckieshere put it: “This mount probably just made more money than StarCraft 2 for 1/1000th of the effort.”

16,"20th Century Studios Dishes on Possible Speed 3, Master and Commander Prequel: 'We Have a Great Script'","Oceans could be battlefields again if 20th Century Studios has its way. In an interview with THR, studio president Steve Asbell hinted at a possibility of a prequel to the 2003 cult classic.

""I’m trying so hard,"" Asbell says. ""It’s the first movie I worked on at Fox twenty years ago. We have a great script. It just needs the right director.""

20th Century Studios really wants to do a Master and Commander prequel. Image source: 20th Century Studios.

Asbell's comments will be music to the ears of Master and Commander fans who have been waiting more than 20 years now for a new movie. A prequel makes sense in light of how much time has passed, but there's plenty to mine from the original source material as well, which spans more than 20 novels.

We wrote in our review of the original movie, ""Like its characters, [Master and Commander's] strengths are numerous and undeniable, and its shortcomings are understated-but-significant. It's a tantalizing glimpse into a world we've never seen protrayed quite like this, and a frustrating taste of what could have been.""

Elsewhere, Asbell digs into the possibility of other revivals, including putting the kibosh on any hopes for another Die Hard (""Not yet"") and Kingsman (""There's no plans on doing them anytime soon""), at least for now. He also responds to star Sandra Bullock's comment that Hollywood may not be brave enough for a Speed 3, laughing, ""Hollywood is brave enough. We are brave enough. We are sitting by the phone.""

He added, ""It is one of those last movies that we haven’t remade. And to really be a reason to come back, it’s got to be a great idea and an idea that excites (Bullock and Keanu Reeves). Because that’d be the reason to see it. It’s obviously a really important title for us, but it’s not something we would handle lightly or just try to press them into service. They’d have to be a part of the development of that idea.""

The full interview also touches on there being not one but two Predator movies, and offers a status update on Avatar 3 and the nascent Alien: Romulus sequel. It seems like there's plenty to look forward to, though a lot of it still years away. For the movies releasing in 2024, check out our list of the biggest movies coming out in 2024.

17,Marvel Reveals Star Wars: Legacy of Vader Series Starring Kylo Ren,"Marvel Comics has revealed its latest ongoing Star Wars series, one set in the immediate aftermath of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Dubbed Star Wars: Legacy of Vader, this new series traces Kylo Ren's journey as he becomes Supreme Leader of the First Order and tries to reconnect with the ghost of his grandfather, Darth Vader.

As revealed by StarWars.com, Legacy of Vader is written by a veteran of both Kylo Ren and Darth Vader comics. Charles Soule previously penned Marvel's 2017 Star Wars: Darth Vader series and 2019's Star Wars: The Rise of Kylo Ren, a limited series that explores Ben Solo's ascent in the First Order and the Knights of Ren. The book is illustrated by fellow Star Wars veteran Luke Ross.

Check out the slideshow gallery below for an early preview of Star Wars: Legacy of Vader #1:

As mentioned, Legacy of Vader is set during the year between the events of The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. In this chaotic period, Ben Solo is seeking to consolidate his new grip on the First Order. But he finds that his motto ""Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to,"" is easier said than done. Still haunted by the murder of his father and his final duel with Luke Skywalker, Ben will seek to commune with the spirit of Darth Vader and recommit himself to the Dark Side. To do so, he'll revisit key worlds in Anakin Skywalker's past, including Mustafar and Tatooine.

“When fans talk to me about my Star Wars work, two of my Marvel comic runs come up more than almost anything else: my 2017 run on Darth Vader with Giuseppe Camuncoli and my 2019 series The Rise of Kylo Ren with Will Sliney,” Soule told StarWars.com. “I think both of those worked so well in part because they were set in parts of the Star Wars timeline full of unanswered questions about characters the audience really loves. This new series is not just a combination of those two books, but also a chance to explore an extremely rich section of the timeline that's almost entirely open: Kylo Ren's time as Supreme Leader of the First Order.”

“Kylo is truly lost at this particular moment. In a very short span of time, he's faced two of his most significant mentors in combat (one of whom is his uncle), killed his own father, almost killed his mother, stolen control of a galaxy-level military that he has no idea how he'll use, and of course, found a deep connection with another Force-user named Rey,” Soule continued. “All of that is swirling around in his emotional matrix, making him deeply unstable, angry, frustrated... dangerous. He's looking for any form of guidance he can get — even if he won't admit it — and so he turns to just about the only thing he's got left, the legacy of his grandfather, the Sith Lord Darth Vader.”

This is one of Marvel's first major projects set after the Star Wars Original Trilogy. Previously, in addition to the aforementioned Rise of Kylo Ren miniseries, Soule penned Star Wars: Poe Dameron, which showcased more of Poe's exploits as a hotshot Resistance pilot. Marvel also recently kicked off Star Wars: The Battle of Jakku, a trilogy of miniseries detailing the final conflict between the Rebellion and the Empire.

Star Wars: Legacy of Vader #1 will be released on February 5, 2025.

18,Sniper Elite: Resistance Targets January 2025 Release Date,"Rebellion’s Sniper Elite: Resistance has a release date: January 30, 2025.

The World War 2 shooter launches then across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and as a day one Game Pass title.

Preorders get a bonus new Target Führer campaign mission, an additional weapon skin, and the Karabiner 98 Rifle. Preordering the Deluxe Edition gets you the classic M1911 Pistol and two days early access.

Sniper Elite: Resistance is the latest game in Rebellion’s quietly popular (20 million players) sniper Elite franchise, which combines stealth gameplay with sniping and is famous for its slow-motion testicle shots viewed through an X-ray kill cam.

Here’s the official blurb:

In Sniper Elite: Resistance, Harry Hawker, agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), takes the lead role for the first time in the series as he discovers an insidious new Wunderwaffe - something so powerful, it guarantees the Nazis would win the war. This new standalone story runs in parallel to the events of Sniper Elite 5 and turns the attention towards the hidden war, far from the front lines, deep within the heart of occupied France.

Resistance missions include optional Kill List targets, multiple infiltration and extractions points, and side missions. It also introduces Propaganda Missions, a brand-new style of side mission to the series. You locate a unique Propaganda poster in each of the main campaign’s levels to unlock a Propaganda Mission where you become a Resistance Fighter.

Sniper Elite: Resistance game features:

Full length, standalone campaign playable in both single-player and co-op

Authentic arsenal of World War 2 weaponry, featuring fan favorites as well as new additions

Customize and upgrade weapons to fit your playstyle

The trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot

Engage in cat and mouse multiplayer in the fan favorite Invasion Mode

Once you’ve set your scope, take things online with adversarial multiplayer

Sniper Elite: Resistance follows 2022’s Sniper Elite 5, which IGN scored 7/10. We said: “Sniper Elite 5 is still a satisfying and spectacularly gross way to shoot Nazis in their nether regions, but it feels like the series needs to start aiming its sights a little higher.”

19,Apple Making Oregon Trail Movie That Will be an Action-Comedy With Barbie-Style Musical Numbers - Report,"Apple is developing a movie based on Oregon Trail, the beloved educational computer game that has spawned multiple generations of in-jokes and memes among gamers.

THR reports that the film, which is currently early in development, will be an action-comedy with a handful of musical numbers in the vein of Barbie. Will Speck and Josh Gordon are reportedly attached to direct, with Kenny and Keith Lucas penning the screenplay alongside Max Reisman. The story, as you might expect, will be about a 19th-century covered wagon train traveling to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.

The Oregon Trail retains a special place in the hearts of generations of gamers.

The musical aspect offers a glimpse of what to expect, suggesting that it will be a fairly irreverent take on the historical adventure. Songwriters and producers Benji Pasek and Justin Paul, who are best-known for their work on La La Land, are among those involved in the film.

The original game was developed as a text-based adventure in 1971 and produced by the Minnesota Educational Computer Consortium starting in 1975. It found a lasting place in pop culture as generations of American school children watched their characters die of typhoid, dysentary, and all manner of other maladies, or wandered around shooting way too many buffalo.

Oregon Trail looks to be the latest classic game to get its own movie, following in the footsteps of Super Mario Bros. and other well-known franchises. The trend has found mixed success, with Mario earning more than a billion dollars, but Borderlands being a flop at the box office.

The Oregon Trail does not yet have a release date. You can find the rest of the biggest movies releasing in 2024 right here.

20,Pyramid Head Creator Masahiro Ito Says He Was Too Busy Making Silent Hill to Get a Girlfriend,"Original Silent Hill art director and Pyramid Head creator Masahiro Ito has said he was too busy making Silent Hill games to get a girlfriend.

PC Gamer spotted a handful of X/Twitter posts from Ito who made clear that his time as a game developer wasn't all sunshine and daisies — and not just because he was working on the terrifying survival horror franchise.

For a four-year period between 1999 and 2003, Konami released Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2, and Silent Hill 3, and Ito was heavily involved in their creation.

""All the time I was attending my art university or was developing Silent Hill 1, 2, 3, and a cancelled title, I never had any girlfriends cause I had no time for it,"" Ito said. ""I never thought I was a genius, but I was terribly competitive. The only way to beat geniuses is to give yourself up entirely to what you wanna accomplish.""

Pyramid Head creator Masahiro Ito was too busy for a girlfriend when developing Silent Hill.

Though Ito didn't say he regrets his time working on the series, which is currently enjoying a resurgence thanks to the criticially and commercially acclaimed Silent Hill 2 remake, Ito has been blunt about the series in the past.

""I wish I hadn't designed f**kin Pyramid Head,"" he said in a 2022 post. This comes alongside criticism of publisher Konami too. ""To use [Pyramid Head] in so many titles makes [Pyramid Head] cheaper,"" Ito said in a now deleted post.

Konami partnered with developer Bloober Team to recreate the game where Pyramid Head debuted. It arrived October 8 to glowing critical reception and strong sales too, leaving many fans of the previously dormant horror franchise eager for more.

In our 8/10 review, IGN said: ""Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror.""

21,Baldur's Gate 3 Publishing Director Says Ubisoft's 'Sub Above Sales' Strategy 'Isn't Sensible',"Following Ubisoft's widely criticized disbanding of the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team, the publishing director of Baldur's Gate 3 has taken to X/Twitter to add his view, saying that Ubisoft's publishing strategy ""just isn't sensible.""

In a post spotted by PC Gamer, Michael Douse said of Ubisoft that the last ""notable game"" on its platform (the Ubisoft store) was ""arguably Far Cry 6 in 2021.""

""The Crew, Mirage and Avatar came in 2023 and didn’t perform, so you can assume subscriptions were at a lull when PoP released by 2024. Which means people wouldn’t be launching their store all too much.

""If it had released on Steam not only would it have been a market success, but there would likely be a sequel because the team are so strong. It’s such a broken strategy. The hardest thing is to make a 85+ [review score] game — it is much, much easier to release one. It just shouldn’t be done as it was.""

The last notable game on their platform was arguably Far Cry 6 in 2021. The Crew, Mirage and Avatar came in 2023 and didn’t perform, so you can assume subscriptions were at a lull when PoP released by 2024. Which means people wouldn’t be launching their store all too much.



If it… https://t.co/uiC167uxGG— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) October 23, 2024

Douse is likely referring here to the fact that at launch, The Lost Crown required players to have a Ubisoft Connect account to play it on most platforms. Though there are workarounds, Ubisoft has pushed its own account, launcher, store, and subscription service fairly heavily over the last several years. What's more, on PC, The Lost Crown was only available at launch through the Ubisoft store or through the Epic Games Store. It didn't make it to Steam until eight months later.

As for the performance of The Crew Motorfest, Assassin's Creed: Mirage, and Avatar: Frontier of Pandora, Douse may well be right. Ubisoft has been remarkably quiet and vague as to how well those three games have done since their launches, and third-party reports indicate none of the three were the smash hits Ubisoft has needed for a while now to right its ship.

But Douse continues:

""If the statement 'gamers should get used to not owning their games' is true because of a specific release strategy (sub above sales), then the statement 'developers must get used to not having jobs if they make a critically acclaimed game' (platform strategy above title sales) is also true, and that just isn’t sensible — even from a business perspective.""

If the statement “gamers should get used to not owning their games” is true because of a specific release strategy (sub above sales), then the statement “developers must get used to not having jobs if they make a critically acclaimed game” (platform strategy above title sales) is…— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) October 23, 2024

Here, Douse is referring to a statement made by Ubisoft executive Philippe Tremblay earlier this year, where he said: ""One of the things we saw is that gamers are used to, a little bit like DVD, having and owning their games. That's the consumer shift that needs to happen. They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection. That's a transformation that's been a bit slower to happen [in games]. As gamers grow comfortable in that aspect… you don't lose your progress. If you resume your game at another time, your progress file is still there. That's not been deleted. You don't lose what you've built in the game or your engagement with the game. So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game.""

Douse's point, then, is that Ubisoft seems to be making it a part of its strategy to force subscriptions over trying to sell units of individual games. And if that's the case, it also seems to be the case that it will prioritize that same strategy over developers being employed - which Douse finds not to be ""sensible.""

This isn't the first time Douse has commented on the industry-wide trend of layoffs and studio closures that's continued over the last several years. Earlier this year, he called the mass layoffs ""an avoidable f*ck up."" And Larian studio head Sven Winke has also condemned the trend, saying in an interview with us earlier this year that ""it's the wrong thing for games.""

22,Daisy Ridley Star Wars Film Reportedly Loses Writer as Peaky Blinders Creator Departs,"The Star Wars: Episode 9 - The Rise of Skywalker sequel led by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and starring Daisy Ridley appears to have lost its screenwriter as Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight has reportedly departed.

Variety learned of his leaving and said Disney is now actively speaking with potential replacements. Knight joined the project in March 2023 after previous writers Damon Lindelof and Justin Britt-Gibson departed.

This setback means production on the currently unnamed sequel won't begin until several months into 2025 at the earliest, Variety said. This means it's unlikely to hit the first of two still open Star Wars release dates of December 16, 2026, and is perhaps more likely to arrive on the next, December 17, 2027 date instead.

Steven Knight has reportedly departed his Star Wars film. Image credit: Anthony Devlin/Getty Images.

Little is known about the film given its lack of writer and release date, though it will focus on Ridley's Rey Skywalker as she rebuilds the Jedi Order 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker. The actress said in November 2023 it's a ""really cool"" film that isn't at all what she expected. ""I haven’t read anything, but I know the story,"" she said at the time. ""It’s really worth telling, worth exploring, and I think people will be excited.""

The next Star Wars film, and the only one with an actual title and release date amid the myriad announced projects, is The Mandalorian and Grogu. This sequel to Season 3 of The Mandalorian hits theatres on May 22, 2026.

The 2026 and 2027 dates Disney has locked in are, as mentioned, still completely open. The Rise of Skywalker sequel was expected to fill the first of these slots but as this is now unlikely, fans are back to the drawing board on figuring out what's coming next.

Possibilities include Logan and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny director James Mangold's film focused on the dawn of the Force, or another set to be a culmination of Star Wars shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian from Lucasfilm's chief creative officer Dave Filoni.

Thor Ragnarok and Love and Thunder director Taika Waititi is also working on a Star Wars film, though its progress is slow and steady as it's not expected until around 2030. Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy's film is in a similar boat, though reportedly picked up a writer in July.

Star Wars: Episode 8 - The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson also has an entire trilogy of films announced, but these aren't in active development either. And finally, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins had a Rogue Squadron movie announced before it was cancelled due to her commitments to Wonder Woman 3. That film was cancelled itself, however, and Jenkins said she still owes Disney a Star Wars script and thus sparked hope that Rogue Squadron is back in development.

23,"Alien: Romulus 2 in the Works: Sequel Would Continue the Story of the First Movie, Fede Alvarez in Talks to Direct","20th Century Studios is working on an idea for Alien: Romulus 2 that would continue the story of the first movie, with Fede Alvarez potentially returning to direct.

Speaking in an interview with THR, 20th Century Fox exec Steve Asbell talked about the success of Alien Romulus and what the next step might be for the sequel. ""We’re working on a sequel idea now. We haven’t quite closed our deal with Fede [Alvarez], but we are going to, and he has an idea that we’re working on,"" Asbell explains.

""The two survivors, Rain and Andy, played by Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, were real highlights of the film. And so I always think of it like, 'Wow, where do people want to see them go next?' We know there’s going to be aliens. We know there’s going to be great horror set pieces. But I fell in love with both of them and I want to see what their story is.""

Alien Romulus managed to revitalize the franchise when it debuted this past summer, raking in around $108 million global debut at the box office. We wrote in our review, ""Evoking the genetic f***ery that always spells doom in these movies, Alien: Romulus is a lean, mean, chimeric beauty.""

Indeed, we're in the middle of an Alien renaissance right now. Alien: Earth is in the works from Noah Hawley and is set to include at least one Xenomorph, and Alien: Isolation 2 is happening as well. Meanwhile, leaning into the nostalgia around the original movie, Alien: Romulus is due to get a home release... on VHS.

As for 20th Century Studios, the Disney-owned company is keeping busy with plans for multiple Predator movies, Avatar 3, and another Apes movie potentially set for 2027.

24,Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preseason Patch Notes Released Amid Global Release Date Rollout,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is rolling out now (some have been playing it for hours at this point), and Activision has published its preseason patch notes that detail changes made to Multiplayer in time for launch. These are in addition to already announced changes based on feedback and data from the beta weekends.

The headline here is that aim assist is much weaker at point blank ranges for launch and smoothly increases in strength out to a short range. Aim assist is always a hot topic within the Call of Duty community with each game’s release, so it will be interesting to see feedback now the game is out in the wild.

Elsewhere, there are improved pistol and dedicated melee swap speeds, a slight increase to weapon butt melee attack speeds, and adjustments to sway, bob, and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS (aim down sights).

Helpfully, Activision included a weapon damage range explainer in the patch notes, which go into detail on how damage actually works in Black Ops 6 and Warzone from Season 01.

We’ve got plenty more on Black Ops 6 ahead of launch, including its built-in support for better audio tech that costs $20, Activision’s new ambitious plans to beat cheaters, and confirmation it doesn't include the dreaded Riot Shield.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preseason Patch Notes

MULTIPLAYER

Weapons

There are 33 weapons at launch waiting for you to unlock and customize. See our full breakdown on weapons at the COD blog.

Weapon Balance

While many weapon balance changes have been implemented across the board since Beta, we consider launch to be our day 1 baseline across the entire arsenal. Weapon balance is always ongoing, so we’ll be evaluating data and feedback, and sharing updates on this regularly.

In the Multiplayer Beta we tested a change that disabled aim assist at close ranges. While this was a change in the right direction, we felt that this was a bit jarring when crossing that close range threshold, so we’ve adjusted our approach to linearly interpolate aim assist strength. This means that aim assist will be much weaker at point blank ranges and smoothly increase in strength out to a short range. We will of course continue to monitor and assess data and player feedback.

Improved Pistol and Dedicated Melee swap speeds

Slight increase to Weapon Butt melee attack speeds

Adjustments to sway, bob and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS Additional improvements coming in Season 01

Improved Depth of Field across all Weapons

Movement

Added a toggle option for Corner Slicing

Added an option to set the hold time to perform a Dive to Prone or Slide depending on your Slide/Dive Behavior setting

Added an Intelligent Movement option to set Mantle Assist Angle from tight, medium, or wide

Multiplayer Map Adjustments

Keen eyes have already noticed a handful of changes we have introduced to our Beta maps thanks to everyone’s amazing feedback. Delivering fair and consistent gameplay will always remain our goal, and as such we’ve introduced some additional cover and changes to make firefights a bit fairer, as well as various lighting changes. The below selects aren’t every change we have made, but they’ll help provide an idea of what to expect from Beta to Launch.

Expanded the cover points around the hot tub at the center of the map.

Added new planters as cover near far spawn point.

Added multiple cover options throughout the map.

Adjusted bullet penetration values on the satellite dish panels to allow additional bullet penetration. The concrete wall at the main overwatch is now broken out, which will allow more bullet penetration to make it slightly less powerful. Panels are doubled up at the side overwatch to still amount a small amount of bullet penetration where there was previously none.

Made additional cover improvements throughout the map.

Made cover improvements across multiple sightlines.

Audio

We’re excited to introduce our best-in-class audio experience coming to Black Ops 6 with the introduction of HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) via Universal Profile in Enhanced Headphone Mode, which is available to all players for free.

We’ve also added a setting to disable licensed music across all modes, particularly useful for content creators streaming the game.

SkylineScudRewind

Adjustments for Future Weapon Damage Patch Notes

Whether you're new to the franchise or a long-time fan, understanding how your weapon of choice deals damage is an essential aspect of Call of Duty gameplay. In the past, our patch notes used some terms to describe damage values at various ranges that could create some mild confusion for some players.

In Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01, we aim to avoid this confusion two-fold:

Creating a new Weapon Damage Adjustment table for Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01 patch notes.

Establishing Weapon Damage Range definitions for Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01 moving forward.

New in Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01, we're introducing a new table to highlight the changes a weapon has undergone from one patch to the next. You'll find it nested within our existing tables in our attempt to keep information as detailed and centralized as possible.

This new table will comprise three columns (Damage Range, Pre-Patch, and Post-Patch) and rows of up to five to account for each applicable Damage Range for a given weapon. In each Pre-Patch/Post-Patch cell, the corresponding Damage and Range (in meters) values will be found.

For easier understanding, we'll identify ""positive"" (⇧) and ""negative"" (⇩) adjustments with an arrow like what you see in-game.

In Black Ops 6 and Warzone: Season 01, not all weapons are created the equal, but all of them respect the fundamental principle that the closer your target is to you, the more damage you will deal to them. Using the following dynamic ranges, we identify how damage works in Multiplayer and Warzone:

Maximum Damage Range

This range outlines the maximum potential damage a weapon can output in a single shot up to a specified distance.

This range will always start at 0 meters and extend outward until a player falls outside of our Maximum Damage Range, where damage begins to ""step down.""

Medium and Minimum Damage Ranges

Picking up right after the Maximum Damage Range ends, we use Medium and Minimum Damage Ranges to identify how damage will ""step down"" in potency over distance.

Remember how we said not all weapons are created equal? Some weapons can have up to three Medium Damage Ranges while some can have zero. In situations where a weapon only has one Medium Damage Range, we will label this Medium Damage range as-is. If a weapon has no Medium Damage Range, we’ll omit over the Medium Damage Range rows.

Medium Damage Ranges Picking up right after the Maximum Damage Range ends, we use Medium Damage Ranges to identify how damage will ""step down"" over distance. Reminder: A weapon with Medium Damage Ranges can have a minimum of one Medium Damage Range and a maximum of three. In all future Damage Range Adjustment tables, we'll identify these Medium Damage Ranges as 1, 2, and 3 when applicable, with One (1) being closest to the player and Three (3) being the furthest within the Medium Damage Ranges. In previous patch notes versions, these were identified as “Close-Mid,” “Near-Mid,” “Mid,” “Mid-Far,” or “Far-Mid.”

Minimum Damage Range This range identifies the minimum potential damage a player can receive at the furthest distances. This range will always pick up right after the furthest Medium Damage Range ends and will continue indefinitely unless otherwise noted. Reminder: Some weapons can have no Medium Damage Range and will enter a Minimum Damage Range immediately after the Maximum Damage Range.



One Last Thing: As we progress through our future Seasons, the teams at Treyarch and Raven will adjust weapons based on feedback and data to deliver the best experiences possible for Multiplayer and Warzone respectively. These adjustments may include shared Black Ops 6 weapons having different Damage Range values between titles.

25,Yooka-Laylee Dev Teases Remaster Release on Nintendo Switch 2,"The developer of the Yooka-Laylee remaster has teased a release on the Switch 2, announcing today the game is set for launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and “Nintendo platforms.”

That’s a clear nod to Nintendo’s next console, which the company has yet to formally announce. But that hasn’t stopped a handful of developers from indicating they’re working on bringing their games to Switch 2.

Last month, with Nintendo fan excitement for Switch 2 reaching fever pitch, Pathea Games, developer of the multi-million selling RPG/farming/life series My Time, announced My Time At Evershine by saying it was “committed” to launching on PC, Xbox Series X and S, PS5, and “future Nintendo platforms yet to be announced.”

Now UK developer Playtonic has got in on the act, announcing that Yooka-Replaylee, the remake of its 2017 spiritual successor to Rare's Banjo-Kazooie, is headed to PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and “Nintendo platforms.” While there’s no release date yet, Yooka-Replaylee’s latest trailer includes the Nintendo logo, as opposed to the Switch logo, with the game’s trademark googly eyes resting on top of “Nintendo.”

Yooka-Laylee's googly eyes rest on the Nintendo logo. Image credit: Playtonic / YouTube.

“Experience the definitive version of Yooka and Laylee's very first adventure on a platform of your choice when the game launches on... wait, too soon for that,” Playtonic teased.

""Ssssstay tuned.""

Nintendo has also said it won’t release the Switch 2 before the end of its current financial year , which runs to March 31, 2025. When it does eventually release the console, Nintendo expects to have plenty of stock available , which in turn will hopefully combat scalping.

So, what other games can fans expect to see on Switch 2? Last year, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said he regretted releasing Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope on the Nintendo Switch , and wished the company had instead waited for the console's successor. Perhaps we will see a Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope Switch 2 port, then.

For more on what may eventually become the Switch 2, you can read everything else we know about the company’s next console .

26,What to Watch: The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3 Ends and Star Trek Lower Decks Season 5 Begins,"Welcome to Streaming Rewind, a weekly breakdown of the new and noteworthy as we work to help readers wade through the absolute deluge of television series and movies in the streaming space.

It may be a slow week for premieres and new releases, but that doesn’t mean the world of streaming had an uneventful few days. Vox Machina dished out a surprisingly heartwarming but equally ominous Season 3 finale, Agatha All Along delivered a heartbreaking exploration of what it really means to be in a coven, and everyone who skipped Trap in the theaters can now watch it on Max. (And you should, because it’s fun.)

The Legend of Vox Machina Wraps Up an Emotional Season

The Critical Role team was clear from the very beginning: Season 3 was always going to rip out our hearts. It did just that, but it also mended them just a tiny bit with a relatively warm Season 3 finale. Of course, there wouldn’t be much intrigue if there wasn’t some stress around what was going to happen to our adventurers going forward. Once again, the series leaves us wondering if Vax (Liam O’Brien) is going to be OK, while also issuing warm farewells that beg the question that any great finale needs to: Where do we go from here?

Agatha All Along: Identity Crisis Edition

It was an emotional week on Agatha All Along. Lilia Calderu (Patti LuPone) had her time in the sun while the episode centered heavily on the true meaning of coven and personal autonomy, but we also learned the true identity of Aubrey Plaza’s Rio and got some more insight on the Teen/William/Billy situation. Turns out, William Kaplan may not be as out of the picture as Episode 5 made it seem, and Billy still doesn’t know how to make heads or tails of his situation.

The End Is Near for Star Trek: Lower Decks

The fifth season of the Paramount+ animated series Star Trek: Lower Decks debuted this week (the first two episodes are available now). This will be the final run for the show, but 50 episodes of animated Trek onboard the USS Cerritos is nothing to sniff at… although according to creator Mike McMahan, we may all be sniffling through our tears by the time the season finale rolls around. Check out our chat with McMahan , where we also quizzed him on some obscure Trek matters as well.

Uh, the End Is Also Near for What We Do in the Shadows

The beloved FX/Hulu vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows is also coming to end after its current season, which just kicked off with the first three episodes. As this sixth season begins, Nandor, Laszlo, Nadja, Guillermo, and Colin Robinson (and The Guide!) have to deal with Jerry (Mike O'Brien)… their other vampire roommate who we never knew about, and who they forgot to wake up 24 years ago. Best line of the season so far? When Guillermo, talking about how he was a shy and lonely child, says that he’s sure Nandor can understand. Nandor replies: “Not really. I was rich and a jock.”

27,Venom: The Last Dance Ending and Post-Credits Scenes Explained - What Is the Future of Eddie Brock?,"Let's make this simple: You want to know if there are any post- or mid-credits scenes in Venom: The Last Dance . The answer is yes! Stick around for both the mid-credits and the final moments after the credits are done rolling.

Full spoilers follow for Venom: The Last Dance. If you haven’t seen the film yet, check out our review first!

The Venom trilogy has come to a close with The Last Dance, and although this movie seems to tie up the story of Tom Hardy’s Eddie Brock and everyone’s favorite brain-munching symbiote, there are still some threads left to pull on in further Sony Marvel movies (there’s also the fact that Hardy has said he’s open to playing the character again ). We’ll get to those in a bit, but first, let’s talk about what actually happens in this movie.

So how does The Last Dance play out? Let’s get into it.

Knull and Void

The Last Dance opens with a scene fans will recognize from the film’s trailers: the (very brief) introduction of Knull, the god of the symbiotes , who was created by Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman. Knull is played by Andy Serkis, who you might recall directed the second Venom film, Let There Be Carnage. Knull is trapped in a void on the planet Klyntar and can only get out via something called the Codex (if you’re getting Man of Steel flashbacks, so are we).

How the Codex works isn’t completely clear, but apparently Venom has one because Eddie briefly died in the past (in the first film), which means Knull is sending his hounds, the Xenophages, to find him. Or, one of them anyway, which arrives on Earth and begins hunting down Venom, with the caveat that it can only “see” the Codex when Eddie is fully transformed into Venom. If Eddie is just himself or with small bits of the symbiote coming out of his body, he’s invisible to the Xenophage.

If either Eddie or Venom is killed, then the Codex will cease to exist.

It’s established early on that the Codex can only survive if both the symbiote and its host are alive. If either Eddie or Venom is killed, then the Codex will cease to exist. So Eddie and Venom are on the run because the Xenophage is trying to get them. They’re also on the run from the government because Eddie is being blamed for some deaths in the last movie, because hey, why not have two motivations for the same action?

This is how Chiwetel Ejiofor’s Rex Strickland and Juno Temple’s Dr. Teddy Payne get in on the action, with the pair working for Area 55, an extra top-secret extraterrestrial research facility built under Area 51, which is just normal top secret we guess, and is currently being dismantled. Dr. Payne has a whole bunch of symbiotes down in her lab, including Toxin , which has been bonded to Stephen Graham’s Patrick Mulligan, who survived the last film. Toxin reveals to Strickland and Payne that Knull is a threat to the entire universe, leading everyone to get on the same page about needing to prevent him from retrieving the Codex. With us so far?

Venom: The Last Dance Ending Explained

The movie culminates in everyone getting to Area 55, where the Xenophage busts in and starts wrecking the place. After Toxin and Mulligan are killed, the other symbiotes are freed and begin bonding with some of the staff to fight off the Xenophage. It’s made clear here that the symbiotes have no evil designs for humanity, and they actively try to help Strickland and his forces fight off the Xenophage. The battle spills outside, where the Xenophage receives backup from more of its kin (why that didn’t happen earlier, we don’t know).

Eddie and Venom save a family of alien enthusiasts who helped them on their journey, led by Rhys Ifans as Martin, who is definitely not Curt Connors from The Amazing Spider-Man. Dr. Payne also becomes bonded with a symbiote during the fighting, who going by her appearance and coloration seems to be Agony from the comics. Payne’s symbiote form also has super-speed powers because she was struck by lightning as a kid. Sure, why not?

With Venom seemingly dead, Eddie is hospitalized, where he's told that his criminal record has been expunged.

Because the Xenophages have remarkable healing factors (they can put themselves back together even after being shredded into dozens of chunks) and kill most of the other symbiotes, it seems Venom and Eddie are toast. Realizing that there’s no way to end Knull’s threat without destroying the Codex, Venom decides to sacrifice himself, separating from Eddie and wrapping himself around the Xenophages, bunching them together as if he were the stickiest bubble gum in the cosmos. He then pulls them and himself under an acid shower that Strickland was using to destroy materials from Area 51. Venom and the Xenophages are killed by the shower (and so is Strickland, because he sets off a grenade which causes the whole thing to explode), vaporizing the Codex. Knull can evidently sense this because we see a shot of him getting in an angry “No!!!!” as this happens. Payne saves her coworker Sadie thanks to her aforementioned super-speed.

With Venom seemingly dead, Eddie is hospitalized, where a random general tells him that his criminal record has been expunged, but under the condition he never tells anyone about his experiences with the symbiotes. Eddie then goes to New York City and looks at the Statue of Liberty (something he and Venom said they wanted to do together), promising to never forget his symbiote pal.

Okay, But What About the Post-Credits Scenes? And Is Venom Really Dead?

As mentioned earlier, The Last Dance has two post-credits scenes that hint at the future of the franchise, even if this run of Venom solo movies is (apparently) over. The first is the mid-credits scene where we get one more look at Knull, who says “your champion has fallen, the King in Black is awake. Your world will burn, and you will watch!” Although his plans were foiled this time around, this tease confirms that Sony wants him to play a major role in more films down the line. Director Kelly Marcel echoed this in an interview with IGN, where she said “this is just the beginning for Knull.”

The second scene is at the very end of the credits, featuring the bartender played by Cristó Fernández, who first appeared in the post-credits scene of Spider-Man: No Way Home . The bartender has a variant in the Sony universe with longer hair, and this one was kidnapped by Strickland’s forces earlier in the film. He emerges from the wreckage of Area 51 and calls out for anyone. We then see a broken vial which once contained a symbiote (seemingly Agony, because there’s some purple light in it) that is approached by a roach. That’s it.

So the big question we have now is: Is Venom really dead? Probably not, because when Strickland captures the bartender, he saves him from a small piece of the symbiote that Venom left behind. Strickland contains this piece in a vial (very similar to the one in the post-credits scene) and we never see it again. We don’t know if this loose thread will be the way Sony revives Venom down the line, but with more Knull and Sony Marvel movies said to be on the way, we’d be surprised if the most popular symbiote character doesn’t return in some form in future films.

The one other loose thread is that Strickland receives orders from a shadowy figure we never see clearly. This appears to be Doctor Dan Lewis, Anne Weying’s fiancé from the previous films, because actor Reid Scott is credited. We don’t know what he’s up to, but he obviously has an interest in the symbiotes. Perhaps we’ll learn more about his plans in Kraven the Hunter or another Sony Marvel film.

So what did you think of Venom: The Last Dance? Do you think this is a worthy ending for Eddie and Venom’s story? Let’s discuss in the comments!

From various Marvel and DC projects to prestige films like Killers of the Flower Moon, formerly sure things have been emerging as duds these days.

But as the original John Wick movie hits its 10th anniversary this week, it’s the perfect time to reflect on how Hollywood failed to recognize the way one hitman’s homicidal rampage to avenge his dead dog actually wrote the new playbook on how to build original movie franchises in this IP-era of Hollywood.

Since the Baba Yaga’s debut in 2014, there have been a ton of clones (Monkey Man, Sisu, Nobody, Violent Night, and even In a Valley of Violence, which is about Ethan Hawke getting revenge after his dog is murdered—but in the Old West). Hollywood has no problem cloning successes, but it never quite figured out what specifically made John Wick such a worthy investment. If it did, we’d be drowning in lower-budget original IP today.

John Wick’s producer, Basil Iwanyk, spelled out the secret of the franchise’s success in the book They Shouldn’t Have Killed His Dog by Edward Gross and Mark A. Altman, saying:

“I was in the market for action movies. Action movies you could make for $25 million plus or minus five. It’s the most obvious thing in the world, but nobody seems to understand that. If you hit the number right, which is not hard to do, your downside’s protected, but you still have a tremendous upside.”

I’d say after four entries, $1 billion in box office revenue, and a TV series spin-off, Iwanyk nailed it, which is wild considering it all started with a $20-$30 million investment. But when Iwanyk says “it’s not hard to do,” he’s being modest. A few lucky things had to fall into place for John Wick to come in on budget and for it to turn out as well as it did.

The film’s first lucky break was finding an action star in a slump.

Breaking the Slump

Listen, there’s no doubt that Keanu Reeves is a star, but, in the early 2010s, his stock was definitely down. Movies like 47 Ronin, Man of Tai Chi, and The Day the Earth Stood Still sure made it seem like the heights of Reeves’ Matrix days were behind him.

The Matrix Reloaded (2003)

It was around this time when Reeves’ agent was trying to drum up some action work for his client when he reached out to his old friend, Basil Iwanyk, who sent over a freshly acquired script about a 75-year-old hitman who goes on a spree after his dog is murdered. This was accompanied by a note for Reeves: “Clearly, you’re not 75.”

This “hitman coming out of retirement” role was perfect for the actor—an action star on the verge of his 50s—who understood the discipline of learning complex fight choreography, and which would serve him well when portraying the Baba Yaga. Frankly, he also needed a win.

And Iwanyk needed someone like Reeves, a recognizable face for the poster, a proven box-office draw (albeit not at that moment), and much-needed ammo for an independent film producer trying to keep his antsy financiers at bay.

But as an indie action movie, if Iwanyk wanted to splurge on Number One on the call sheet, he was going to have to cut back on budget elsewhere.

Enter directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch.

Being Thrifty

The pair go way back in stunt work. Stahelski worked as a stunt double for Brandon Lee on The Crow and for Reeves on The Matrix movies. Leitch also had an impressive stunt resume, including for titles like V for Vendetta, I Am Legend, and Blade.

But Stahelski and Leitch weren’t just stunt guys. They were also entrepreneurs, and in 1997 they had a great idea. The two started the action design company 87eleven, which helps filmmakers choreograph and create pre-vis movie fights. Basically, they used their gym to test out and improvise fight choreography and camera angles that would inform how the scene would eventually be shot.

The 87eleven team figuring out fight coreography.

Action movies are expensive, but 87eleven’s ability to design fights in a gym with a small, relatively inexpensive team is a huge boon for a small-budgeted action flick, because it makes the creative process cheaper, thus allowing for more of the budget to be put on screen. Plus, when they actually shoot the scene, it's all business. They already know the moves they need to execute and the shots needed to make it all work in the editing room.

So while Reeves is just stacking bodies during a home invasion, or in a night club, or in a parking lot, almost no time was wasted while shooting because Stahelski and Leitch did their homework. Everything, from the blocking, to the camera work, to the digital squibs were planned before anyone walked on set.

Remember, Iwanyk was convinced that if he could make John Wick for under $25 million, there was no way he could lose money. Using the 87eleven method allowed the team to think cheap and minimize the time needed to do the expensive part: shooting the fights.

Shooting the Fights

The necessity for the film to come in on budget no matter what led to one of the franchise’s oft-imitated aesthetic decisions: the long, unbroken action takes. When the first film came out, the filmmakers claimed it was a stylistic choice. But by the time John Wick 3 arrived, the truth was revealed: Most of what they did with long takes was because they couldn’t afford a second camera.

2014's John Wick

It’s just another example of the old adage “limitation breeds creativity.” Arguably, John Wick’s primary stylistic contribution to the genre was born because they didn’t have the budget to shoot their action scenes the way a larger-budgeted movie would have. Later, when The High Table minted more coins for bigger sequels, Stahelski (who would take on sole director credit for the follow-up films) didn’t go to the bigger-budget way of doing things. Instead, he and the team innovated more (but we’ll get to the sequels in a bit).

Car Chases on the Cheap

Fight scenes alone do not a great action franchise make: Car chases are also a must. John Wick’s climactic car chase—where John basically uses his car as a weapon to swipe, hit, and otherwise incapacitate the goons of Michael Nyqvist’s Viggo long enough to reach out and shoot them—has a little bit of everything that a great car chase needs: e-brake 180s, donuts, cars getting absolutely totaled... and falling from high places. It’s all there!

John Wick has a little bit of everything that a great car chase needs.

Nothing about shooting car chases is cheap. But just because the production wasn’t able to flash the cash yet, it was still able to squeeze in a quality third-act chase, and it’s a masterclass in cutting corners to save money without sacrificing the cinematic thrills. Stahelski and Leitch made two really thrifty choices to pull it off.

First, the chase takes place in one location. While I’m sure it wasn’t cheap to lock down the Brooklyn Navy Yard, it had to be cheaper than paying to close down multiple city streets, which in New York can definitely be pricey. By localizing the car chase to one location, and shooting at night when there’s not a ton of dock work happening, the production was able to stretch its budget.

The other thing they did was use reasonably priced modern cars. Vehicles like Wick’s Dodge Challenger and the mob’s Chevy Tahoes are such ubiquitous cars in the U.S., they look like they rolled off a Hertz lot that morning. Plus, to get all the shots they needed, the team had to buy multiple versions of each car. Sure, Challengers and Tahoes aren’t the cheapest, but they are by no means luxury or classic cars, which when used could dramatically increase the cost of a chase.

The production kept costs down with the types of cars they used.

Would it have been nice to see John tool around in that sick Chevelle we see in later films, doing donuts and shooting goons? Sure. But does the car John was driving make or break the scene? No. And that’s a big part of what made the John Wick filmmakers so good at their job: They made calculated choices on how to maximize their budget… for maximum action.

When John Wick was released in 2014, it made $86 million worldwide on its $25 million budget, proving Iwanyk to be correct on his gamble. That almost 4x return from just the box office, never mind physical and digital media sales and streaming rights, would prove to be more than enough money to double down on a follow-up and do what sequels do best: Escalate the action.

""I was in the market for action movies you could make for $25 million plus or minus five. It's the most obvious thing in the world ... If you hit the number right ... your downside's protected, but you still have a tremendous upside."" - Basil Iwanyk

The Sequels: Doubling Down on the Action

One of the main things that made the John Wick franchise so successful was that the franchise’s formula was distilled so clearly in the first one, and so all the filmmakers had to do was improve on it in the sequels. John Wick 1 was so elegantly simple plot-wise that it allowed the filmmakers to focus on the action. And because the success of the franchise has been in leveraging its creativity to not think outside the box, but in it, every sequel has built upon that philosophy.

John Wick: Chapter 2

For John Wick: Chapter 2, the budget was doubled to $40 million, and you can see where it went within the first minute of the film.

Gone are the cars that look like they were rented that morning. John could now afford to fuck up a few classic Mustangs as he tears around a taxi depot wiping out what’s left of the Russian mob from the first film.

John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)

The fight scenes also featured more complex combat styles. Reeves trained for months, learning 3-gun shooting, which made the film’s gun fu fights significantly more sophisticated than the first.

And then there was the house of mirrors set, an excellent piece of production design that took all the elements of an iconic John Wick scene—brutal hand-to-hand combat, interesting lighting, long-take camera work, and utilizing the location as an active character in the fight—and used the budget to push the sequence into another echelon of production value that the first film couldn’t hope to afford.

John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)

John Wick: Chapter 2 was another success for the franchise, making $171 million worldwide—not Avengers money, but enough to ensure that being “excommunicado” wasn’t going to stop The High Table from exacting their revenge on John… while cameras rolled, of course.

John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum

For John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, the budget almost doubled again, this time to $75 million. And again the Wick team found success by working with their limitations and using more of the same ingredients that made the previous entries successful.

The film’s production design is the perfect example of this. Stahelski and company needed to design a new set that would push the John Wick philosophy that a place could be character itself. And what’s cooler than having ninjas hiding in a house made out of glass where you can’t hide anything?

John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019)

Talk about limitations breeding creativity. To pull off this illusion, multiple departments had to work together to realize a setting that offered tantalizingly small slivers of shadow for the ninjas to hide in plain sight. But that was all just lighting and camera blocking; let us not forget the brutal fight choreography, stunt work, and many glass panes that had to give their lives for this fight to be so exhilarating.

The glass house set might have been the film’s most sophisticated piece of production design, but the film’s most sophisticated fight was definitely the one involving Halle Berry’s “dog fu” at the mint. Her character’s Belgian Malinos were trained since birth for this fight scene, not only to listen and act on command, but more importantly to stay calm on set… especially one as hectic as a John Wick production.

“Dog fu”

Safety is paramount, not only for the dogs but also the stunt performers. When 60 pounds of murder floof is coming for your arm, your leg, or your balls, you want to make sure the dog is hitting its mark.

The Malinos fight wasn’t the only sequence where Parabellum was pushing the limits of animal action, though. Reeves did extensive equestrian training so he could do all the stunt riding in the horse chase through the streets of Brooklyn. They even built a huge rig to shoot the scene. It did pretty much everything: held all the safety wires for the star and the horse; had cameras mounted everywhere; and even had programmable lights to make it look like John Wick and his trusty steed were running past street lights.

VFX breakdown by Method Studios.

While all this was done for real, the crew did have to lay down rubber pads on the road to make it safe for the horse to run on, which meant all the streets had to be digitally replaced.

In fact, this was the first Wick film to lean heavily into visual effects. The motorcycle katana fight on the Verrazano Bridge was pretty much all CGI, and they relied on CGI for the glass and some throwing knifes in a knife fight—mostly because that was probably the only safe way to shoot these things.

Parabellum was the franchise’s biggest success at that time, bringing in over $327 million worldwide. That’s the kind of return that gets you a nine-figure budget for a sequel, and for John Wick: Chapter 4, that’s exactly what happened.

John Wick: Chapter 4

Coming in at two hours and 50 minutes, with only 380 words spoken by John Wick, Chapter 4 provides an obnoxious amount of time for action that Chad Stahelski gleefully filled.

With a $100 million budget, they designed action sequences so bombastic the filmmakers could actually tweak the tried and true formula for John’s final showdown with The High Table. The Arc de Triomphe “car fu” fight is the perfect example of this expanded ambition, and arguably the most sophisticated sequence of the franchise. It's a car chase, a shootout, and a brawl all in one.

Despite not actually being shot on location at the Arc, it’s not any less impressive, mostly because all the stunts and action are still real. Besides all the training and prep, it took a small army of stunt people to do all the driving, combat, and collisions, using dummy cars—that would be replaced in post—to make the impacts feel more real. The result is an action scene that used CGI not to fake any of the stunts, but to transpose the action from an airport in Germany to the Arc.

But the one thing that’s for sure not fake: Keanu Reeves power-sliding to pick up his gun. It took a few takes, but he actually did it.

John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)

This sequel also features multiple locales that prove Chapter 4 was at the top of the series’ set-design game. The Osaka Continental fight alone could have been the climax in any of the other movies, but that was just an amuse-bouche for Killa’s (Scott Adkins) night club and the stair fight, which all do what John Wick production design is known for: visually stylized locations that do their part to get in John’s way, while still not giving all the nameless goons a prayer of a chance.

The High Table

It may have taken four films for The High Table to finally put John Wick into an early grave, but they provided some of the most iconic action to come out of Hollywood in the past decade. It’s insane to think that John Wick managed to single-handedly fight his way into what’s left of our monoculture, despite not being a beloved comic, novel, or intellectual property of some sort. While the sequels continued to expand the aesthetic horizons of modern action sequences by going bigger and bigger, none have matched the brilliance of the first.

The first John Wick’s plot makes the viewer instantly empathize with the reluctant hero, which is the key to the whole franchise. Basil Iwanyk understood that when you pan for gold, if you’re really lucky, you might not find huge nuggets, but a little bit of gold dust. The empathy that was baked into the plot of John Wick 1 was the gold dust, and all it took was $25 million to prove there was a vein of gold just waiting, rich with action.

To me, John Wick is an even more impressive success than the MCU, not because of the subjective quality of the films, or the amount of money made at the box office, but because at one time John Wick was just a movie script on a pile of other scripts. It had no fans. It had no outside hype. It was just fate. Basil Iwanyk was looking for a $25 million action movie to produce, he stumbled on an aging hit man tale, and over four films turned it into one of the few new original movie franchises to gross over $1 billion. The best stories always have humble beginnings. If Hollywood wants to show audiences something new and cool, it just needs to start small and give them time to grow.",2024-10-24 17:59:45+00:00,Michael Calabro
29,The Legend of Vox Machina: Percy’s Pepperbox Has Only Gotten More Relevant with Time,"This article contains spoilers for The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3.

The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3 kicks off with an arc that Critical Role fans will be quite familiar with. Percy’s (Taliesin Jaffe) character arc is connected pretty heavily to his pepperbox which, in this world, is the first gun. The gun control conversation has been a fervent one in this country for decades and now, nine years after the campaign first debuted, things have only gotten worse.

While Taliesin wasn’t able to join us for our interview at Fantastic Fest, Marisha Ray, Liam O’Brien and Travis Willingham — all executive producers and creators of The Legend of Vox Machina — were able to speak to Percy’s complex story and how it’s only gotten more pertinent as time has gone on.

“Taliesin was, I think, brilliant when he made Percy originally, and tying in this gunslinger thing, bringing in firearms into the world, balancing invention against consequence [and] how that's handled,” Willingham says. “Obviously it'll have ripples throughout Exandria. It's not just something that's in Vox Machina, it's in Mighty Nein, it's a pervasive thing. But also having Orthax, the shadow demon, come back from Season 1 and then pop up in Season 3. And I think for me, as a fan of fantasy, understanding the rules of trying to squash a demon of that variety, and also knowing that other characters can seek vengeance and also bring that in as well was really, really interesting and will obviously affect Percy [...] I don't think that's something you shake off.”

Orthax the shadow demon trades in vengeance, something that’s been deeply rooted in Percy’s character from the start. Now that he’s begun to move on from that impulse (and, y’know, been given a new lease on life), Orthax’s hold has gotten more complex. While he’s now tied to Ripley (Kelly Hu), her goal to put pepperboxes in the hands of the defenseless in order to level the playing field is tied to her goal of ultimate vengeance against those who wronged her village, yes, but it’s also connected to Percy as the creator of the weapon itself.

“What I love is that our villains in particular, they have their points,” says Ray. “There is no such thing as a black-and-white argument. So there's elements to Ripley's argument where she's like, ‘I feel like some of this is unfair. You have mages and wizards running around blasting fireballs. Where does that leave the rest of us when wanting to defend ourselves?’""

Ray hits the nail on the head when it comes to Ripley’s complexity. Her thirst for vengeance may have twisted her into a monster, but she’s not necessarily wrong in her desire to protect the masses from the, forgive the reductiveness here, bigger guns.

When I was first getting introduced to the series back in Season 1, all I could think every time Vox Machina ran into battle was “now what is this gangly human gonna do when he’s surrounded by elves and barbarians and magic users?” Percy balances the scales with more than just his pepperbox but, from the outside looking in, it’s easy to tie his survival up to this point directly to his weapon.

“It's a recurring theme that I think pops up in different places for us in this animated series and elsewhere, just who gets to hold the power on different scales,” O’Brien adds.

For someone like Ripley, a woman who had everything ripped away from her, it’s hard to want anything but that power balance. Especially when all she wants at this point is revenge for what she’s lost. And, in a world full of dragons and mages, how can humans expect to protect themselves if not through weaponry?",2024-10-24 16:26:14+00:00,Amelia Emberwing
30,Lower Decks Boss Mike McMahan Takes Our Kind of Weird Star Trek Quiz,"It’s hard to believe that Star Trek: Lower Decks ’ final season has arrived, but after five years and 50 episodes, the animated Trek created by Mike McMahan is in fact coming to an end. In the Season 5 premiere, ""Dos Cerritos,"" the crew of the USS Cerritos encounter versions of themselves from another reality… versions that get them thinking about the paths their own lives have taken.

When I spoke to McMahan recently, he explained that his goal for this final season was to wrap up the “Lower Decks era” of Mariner, Boimler, Rutherford, and Tendi’s lives, but not their overall stories. “You'll see in the finale that it does feel like a resolution of the concept of the show, but also introduces opportunities for other shows with these characters as they're moving forward,” he explains, before laughingly adding, “The gross way to say it is there's a bunch of fun backdoor pilots at the very end of it, but it feels final for the stories we've been telling.”

'The gross way to say it is there's a bunch of fun backdoor pilots at the very end, but it feels final for the stories we've been telling.'

Whether or not the Lower Deckers pop up elsewhere in the Star Trek universe remains to be seen ( Mariner and Boimler did already make the jump to live-action for a Strange New Worlds episode last year). But McMahan promises that a bunch of legacy Trek characters will appear in Season 5 of Lower Decks, courtesy of the quantum reality introduced in the season premiere. “The alternate visions of [the Cerritos crew] that you see in the premiere is also a mechanism to get unexpected legacy people later on,” promises the showrunner. “Without messing with the timeline and without resorting to time travel or holodeck stuff.”

Lower Decks' Season 5 parody poster, riffing on Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.

So stay tuned on that front! In the meantime, I’ve interviewed McMahan several times since the debut of Lower Decks, and I’ve quizzed him on his Trek knowledge on more than one occasion. Dude knows his stuff! So with the final season of the show now here, I figured we’d try some more obscure quiz questions this time around…

Oddest Captain Picard Moment

Captain Jean-Luc Picard is usually a pretty straight-laced, tea-drinking, by-the-book Starfleet officer. Usually…

McMahan: “Probably when you can see his balls in ‘Captain's Holiday.’ We could have had slightly, slightly longer shorts, ladies and gentlemen. And it took me 40 years of living to find out that so many of those original TNG episodes were the same costume designer as TOS. When you're watching people on that planet where they're romping around, the one where Wesley falls into the bush and they want to execute him, and in HD... Man, if I was a kid and HD had existed then. You learn a lot about anatomy from HD transfers of TNG that I didn't know. I mean a lot. There should be a nipple warning at the front of these episodes now.”

'Probably when you can see his balls in Captain's Holiday.'

Favorite Trek Captain Who Wasn’t a Series Regular

We all have a favorite Star Trek captain, but then there are the captains who only get a guest episode or one-shot appearance…

McMahan: “It's so funny. Pike is now removed from that docket [because he’s on Strange New Worlds]. … I loved when Sulu was captain just so briefly, but just getting hit by the Praxis effect … I freaking loved that movie. I just took my son to that and then had the weird experience of being recognized by other Trek fans there where I was like, ‘No, I'm an animation showrunner. I know that I have a very distinct lack of hair, but you should be recognizing Tawny [Newsome] and Jack [Quaid], not me.’ But just seeing Sulu at the helm, you can't watch that and not be like, ‘Give me more of that.’

“And then it's hard to pick [a guest captain] in TNG and in Deep Space Nine, because so many of them have dark turns at the ends of episodes. If you're not the lead of the show, usually you're a dick bag by the end of the episode, and you've been taken away by Starfleet. But yeah, I'll go with Sulu. I would've loved to have seen more.”

Favorite Tellarite

The least glamorous of the founding member races of the United Federation of Planets, the Tellarites have nonetheless been around since The Original Series. Sure, they look like pig-men, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have a favorite.

McMahan: “Well, I wrote a Short Trek that had a nefarious Tellarite in it, who is fighting with Harry Mudd, that I got to spend a week filming with. So he's my favorite Tellarite. Personally, the Tellarite I've met and worked with.

“I do like the TOS Tellarites. They’re so fucking freaky looking. They look like those hollow-eyed pig people. But yeah, despite Tellarites being founding members of the Federation, I do feel like they've gotten short shrift, because they're weren’t as big in TNG. They kind of got sidelined with the Andorians and Orions. You know what I mean? Klingons kind of took over. But yeah, I think you got to love the Tellarite you're on set with.

Captain Kirk tries to not act weirded out by this Tellarite on TOS.

“Lower Decks was in development, but we hadn't sold it, and Aaron Baiers, who works with [Trek boss] Alex [Kurtzman], came and asked me if I liked Harry Mudd and if I wanted to take a crack at it. I was like, ‘Yeah, obviously.’ I wrote ‘The Escape Artist,’ and Rainn Wilson starred and directed it. When we were making that is when I was on set, and [Jonathan] Frakes was directing a Season 2 Discovery episode. And I ran into him at a bar or a hotel restaurant and showed him the pitch artwork that we were about to take out for Lower Decks, and asked him if we sold it, would he be in it? And that's why he's in the finale of the first season.”

Least Favorite Vulcan

Everyone loves Spock, but we’ve seen a bunch of Vulcans over the years and, really, a lot of them have kind of been jerks?

McMahan: “That's pretty easy. Most of them are complete assholes. So I’ve got two answers to this. I feel like any non-T'Pol Vulcan from Enterprise was such a dick bag that I really feel like they blurred the lines between Romulans and Vulcans with those guys. Vulcans were spiritual before, and they kind of became institutional in Enterprise, so I didn't love those Vulcans. I love T'Pol though, because she was the Lower Deck Vulcan.

Live long... and stop acting like a bunch of jerks.

“The structurally – as a writer – Vulcan I like the least is Spock's brother, because the idea of having a Vulcan that has emotion removes the fun of a Vulcan. I love [the movie he’s in, Star Trek V]. I used to not love that movie. I used to like the first half hour of it, and then a couple of seasons ago we did a parody version of it where Boimler basically is like, ‘Well, Mariner got to have a movie, and I have contractual parity to her, so I should get to do a holodeck movie.’ And he's kind of the Shatner of the episode. And I watched Star Trek V three or four times while we were working on that episode, and by the end of it I was like, ‘Man, I fucking love this movie.’

“There's this one line that my wife told me I wasn't allowed to repeat anymore … ‘You can't make your problems go away with the wave of a magic wand!’ … She's just like, ‘Please do not reference the magic wand.’”

Favorite or Weirdest Tool Geordi Ever Used

TNG’s Geordi La Forge wasn’t just the chief engineer of the USS Enterprise, but he was also the keeper of some of the strangest and occasionally cheesiest tools seen in the entire Alpha Quadrant.

McMahan: “Oh, man. For me, I like whenever he would lift the flap of Data's head and just zibbity-zibbity-zibbity, because they're best friends. And sometimes I'll be talking to my best friend, and I'm like, ‘Man, this guy's being a fucking idiot. I wish I could lift a flap on him and zibbity-zibbity him.’

""We're best friends, Data? Right? Right!?""

“Also, every time we're introducing a new sci-fi tool in Lower Decks, I try to go and find prop reuse across the different series so that we can then use that prop, so that in the Memory Alpha [wiki] where it [says it] was used for this, this, that, they have to add another line – literally draw it into the show. They were just going into the cabinet and pulling out sci-fi stuff and redressing it. You'll see exocomps upside down and painted silver being used as engine pieces and stuff.

“Actually, there's lines of dialogue buried in Lower Decks [where Commander] Billups will be like … I'll look up what the tools were used for, and he'll be like, ‘Grab me the thing that looks like the thing. … Grab me the ion decelerator that looks like the plasma router.’ And if you go into Memory Alpha, it's an ion decelerator [that] they reused the prop as a plasma router. There's insane deep cuts that are production jokes in Lower Decks that archeologists wouldn't be able to dig up. … I also love what we call the Tucker tubes, which is that prop that you see in so many sci-fi things, which are the pieces of metal that have the neon tube between them. I love me a big tube, an engineering tube I love.”

31,Spider-Man 2 Version 1.004.000 Adds New Graphics Modes and Ray Tracing,"Insomniac Games has published an update for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 that allows players to take advantage of the graphics and performance options for the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro.

The Sony developer announced the update , along with a similar update for 2021’s Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart , on social media today. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch 1.004 is almost entirely focused granting owners of the soon-to-release console additional visual options to ensure they are either swinging through New York City with improved graphics or a higher framerate.

Insomniac deploys PS5 Pro updates for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart.

Insomniac says that the default will be set to Performance Pro mode, which targets 60fps “while retaining the image quality of the standard Fidelity mode through use of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR).” This is the setting that the team recommends, as it also toggles on all ray-tracing (RT) features.

On the flip side is the 30fps Fidelity Pro mode. Insomniac says this is the visual option for those looking to “experiment” with some of the new ray-tracing features offered by the PS5 Pro, which can be tuned to each player’s preference. With Fidelity Pro, you may also notice that pedestrian and traffic density may be increased in a few locations in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, with hair detail also getting a bump.

Update 1.004 also comes with a trio of new graphical toggles: RT Key Light Shadows, RT Reflections & Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. All three tools are for those who like to tailor their gaming experiences right down to the finest details, though Insomniac warns that you’ll notice changes in certain portions of New York more than others.

Expect many of the same PS5 Pro enhancements if you check out Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart update 1.005, too, including a default Performance Pro mode and Fidelity Pro mode. This patch also fixes “missing fur wetness” in some of the cinematics that take place on Corson V.

The PS5 5 Pro won’t be out for another few weeks, but it’s still caused quite the stir among fans of Sony’s gaming endeavors since the company pulled back the curtain last month . The device was revealed to cost a steep $700 , drawing criticism from those who believe the upgrade isn’t worth the price . We’ll know more about just how substantial the improvements are come launch next month.

While we wait for the PS5 Pro to launch on November 7, you can check out our hands-on preview . You can also check out why we think Sony’s latest hardware release is too much for too little . Finally, you can see full patch notes for both Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart below.

This mode targets a smooth 60 frames per second while retaining the image quality of the standard Fidelity mode through use of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR). All ray-tracing (RT) features are on, including ray-traced reflections, ray-tracing on water, and ray-traced window interiors. This mode is recommended for most players.

FIDELITY PRO

This mode targets 30 frames per second for players who want to experiment with new ray-tracing graphical features. These new features can be tuned individually to reach higher intermediate frame rates, especially when using the “VRR” or “120 Hz Display Mode” options. Pedestrian and traffic density may be increased in some areas, and fine hair detail is increased.

NEW GRAPHICAL TOGGLES

RT Key Light Shadows : Off (Performance) / On (Fidelity default) Use ray-tracing to calculate sun shadows at mid- to far-distance, replacing cascaded shadow maps. This improvement is most impactful on city views. Only available in the “Fidelity Pro” graphics mode.

RT Reflections & Interiors : Medium (Performance) / High (Fidelity default) Set the quality level for ray-traced reflections and building window interiors. The “Medium” setting ray-traces at half render resolution, and the “High” setting ray-traces at full render resolution. The “High” setting will also improve smoothness of animation in reflections and interiors. Only available in the “Fidelity Pro” graphics mode.

RT Ambient Occlusion : Off (Performance) / Medium / High (Fidelity default) Use ray-tracing to compute additional ambient occlusion lighting information. The “Medium” setting uses that information to augment screen-space ambient occlusion. The “High” setting also adds a screen-space GI bounce for additional ambient lighting information. The visual impact of this feature will vary greatly based on the scene.

32,Cronos: The New Dawn Interview - What Silent Hill 2 Remake Developer Bloober Team Is Doing Next,"Bloober Team was once known for creating smaller scale horror games such as Layers of Fear and The Medium, but with the Silent Hill 2 remake and incoming Cronos: The New Dawn, it's looking to reach new heights as a developer.

IGN spoke with Cronos director and producer Jacek Zieba alongside director and designer Wojciech Piejko to discuss the past, present, and future of Bloober Team soon after it revealed Cronos and just days after the Silent Hill 2 remake was released to critical acclaim and one million sales.

Coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam, Cronos is set in a post apocalyptic 1980s Poland and promises a ""twisted time travel story"" in Bloober Team's first foray into an original survival horror franchise. We discussed how it came to be, what other iconic franchises did and didn't influence its creation, and much more.

Chronos: The New Dawn is the next big game from Bloober Team.

IGN: Congratulations on the reveal! That must be very exciting and probably nerve-wracking. How long has Cronos been in development?

Jacek Zieba: We started pre-production somewhere during the end of [2021 release] The Medium, the ideas and everything. When we finished The Medium parts of the team were designated to start doing Cronos, so now it's in an advanced state of production.

Wojciech Piejko: Before The Medium was finished, we sat with leads and other guys and came up with the new idea for the game and that was how Cronos was born.

IGN: How does it feel now to finally have it out in the wild and show off what you've been working on for so long?

WP: It's surreal. Surreal and a big relief. It's always like a nerve-wracking thing. I think there are two big moments in development. Of course, the release, which is the most nerve-wracking one. But the second one is this, the moment we are sharing right now, showing the first trailer of the game, seeing the feedback

So it was a big relief of course and a big moment for the company, that we are doing this two hit combo after releasing Silent Hill with all the great reception, and we are really thankful for all the players. And now this also seems to resonate with people. So we are super excited and super relieved. And of course it'll give us a second wind. 'Okay, now it's real. Now we need to finish it and fulfill the dream.'

IGN: Is it difficult to actually just settle down now back into work today without constantly checking out the comments and the conversations around the trailer?

WP: Exactly. It is what is happening in the studio since this morning. [Sharing] reaction videos and comments. We are really, really happy.

IGN: Was it a very planned and intentional move to reveal Cronos so soon after Silent Hill?

JZ: In a way, yes, because we have two big teams, two big projects started some time ago. So yeah, we knew that this day would come that we can reveal it, but it's not like we made this decision two years ago or something. Those kind of decisions are very tricky and sometimes you just seize the moment like, 'Okay, this is the time now, we should do it here.' So it's like, you're sometimes just waiting and you are just prepared for this kind of stuff.

WP: Yeah, it's also like the stars are aligned. The reception of Silent Hill is great; now Microsoft wants us on their show. So okay, maybe that's good moment because we've got this trailer prepared and we were looking for a perfect moment. We saw a lot of comments like, 'How? Do you guys sleep?'

IGN: I think it's fair to say the Silent Hill 2 remake is the biggest and most significant release for Bloober that has put you on the map more than any previous release. It had positive critical reception and you just announced one million sales too. Has that energized you? Has it influenced Bloober Team in other ways?

JZ: I think that energized us, yeah. We proved we could do it as a team, as a company, because the team poured all their hearts into it. I think it was very tough for them, seeing what happened on the internet for years and to now say to everyone, 'Okay, you were wrong. We can do it and people really like it.' That's the most important stuff.

People really like it so we can be in this together with players, because all of the people in Bloober are also big fans of Silent Hill and put a lot of love into their remake. So that's a big reward for everybody here. But yeah, it's a great success, the biggest as you said, but it only gave us energy to keep going further. That's our new strategy. It's not like, 'Let's just be bigger and bigger. Let's just create better and more interesting games than before.'

WP: To be honest, I can't express enough how happy we are with the release of Silent Hill 2. The team did great, a really tremendous job against all the odds, against all the comments saying we don't deserve to touch this legendary game and everything. We are all fans of Silent Hill. So for us it was a dream come true. So of course it was hard for the team, but they overcome everything and made the impossible possible. We love the new version of Silent Hill, which is still true to the original and added some more content which people like. So yeah, we are thrilled. We are thrilled.

IGN: Let's talk about Cronos. Can you give me the synopsis, the elevator pitch on what this game is?

WP: Alright, so you are a traveler, a mysterious person hidden beneath this environmental suit and you've been sent to the ruins of human civilization with the goal of looking for time rifts. During your exploration you'll need to survive encounters, solve some puzzles, and overcome anomalies that you saw [in the trailer] like floating buildings and other elements. This is our own take on puzzles in this game and you need to look for the time rifts that I mentioned, jump back in time, and extract key people who didn't survive the apocalypse.

IGN: What can you tell me about the apocalypse itself and what's clearly gone very wrong in this world?

JZ: I think only the name of it! It's The Change. The Change happened and the rest is mystery at this point.

WP: The Change happened in the eighties, in Poland. We love to share our culture and the environment and architecture in Poland. It's an alternative version of history. The Change, this apocalyptic event happened in the eighties, and that's where we are.

JZ: This is also why our sci-fi is more retro, something like Alien or the old Star Wars. So it's more analog than flashy. No new tech.

IGN: What are your other inspirations? Fans are comparing it to Dead Space and also seeing lots of classic survival horror like Silent Hill in it too

JZ: Definitely Dead Space is there because of the protagonist and stuff, We can share a little about a special approach to combat. Just like Dead Space has the cut off the limbs mechanic, we also have something we will share later. Also like Alan Wake with the flashlight.

WP: It's something that brings up the tension. It's not only run and gun but you need to think. We put a little more strategy in the combat.

JZ: Besides those, Japanese survival horror, like the Resident Evil series, the old ones, the remakes. Those were a very, very big inspiration for us

WP: In terms of movies, films like 12 Monkeys. Our biggest film or TV series inspiration is Dark, the TV series by Netflix. It tells a story about time travel and a fictional German town, so a very European thing. We thought the same, 'Okay, we can set the game in Poland. We can also use time travel.' This showed us we can do it and people are interested in it. We don't need to make the game about somewhere else. Let's show culture, let's show Poland. Oh and The Thing [is another inspiration].

JZ: Also Annihilation with Natalie Portman was a very, very big influence.

IGN: Having mentioned these other game franchises, do you want Cronos to be a competitor to Resident Evil, to Silent Hill?

WP: Our goal was to create our first IP in the survival horror genre because, of course, Silent Hill is a property of Konami and, we are really grateful and honored to be able to work on this game, but with Cronos we wanted to make something ours, with our vision of the survival horror game and mixing the elements that we have mastered through the years.

We were always a storyteller, so we still want to tell a good story, but this time we would like to also incorporate more gameplay into it. So expect a survival horror game like the games you mentioned, Resident Evil, Dead Space, Silent Hill. Those are the type of games we... We would like to be among them. But yeah, I think it's our own take. That was a goal of this journey of the new Bloober, to expand and have more gameplay oriented games but still telling good stories.

IGN: What lessons did you learn from The Medium that influenced the creation of Cronos?

JZ: I think after The Medium it was very clear to us that we needed to evolve. It was like, 'let's end the chapter of the adventure games.' Layers of Fear, Observer, and The Medium, [games that were] strange, experimental, with fixed camera tools. 'Okay, let's finish with that.'

We also want to evolve, so let's go into survival horror, let's create something of our own, something different than other games in the genre in terms of world, story, and also gameplay. Let's create another game of our dreams.

WP: It's a privilege to make the games that you would like to play yourself for horror fans. We are in the studio making Silent Hill, Cronos. it's like a dream combination.

IGN: The general strategy of Bloomberg Team 3.0 is to redefine the genre, so how is this game doing that? What are your plans to make this the new benchmark for survival horror games?

JZ: I don't know if we can say.

WP: We've got these features, the one mentioned before, our take on combat. We are trying to expand the idea, not only of survival horror [mechanics] like a limited inventory and stuff, but also add some new ideas to it. I think it's all about the mixture, making different pizzas with different ingredients, and I hope this one will be really tasty.

IGN: Which themes, of sci-fi or horror or time travel, did you lean into most when making Cronos?

WP: We of course knew that we were doing the Silent Hill game, so we didn't want to overlap with, let's say a more grounded story. We said, 'Okay, we will be doing this, so we need to go somewhere else to have a different world, to not repeat ourselves.' So yeah, that's how we came up with Cronos.

IGN: Cronos was in development when both the Dead Space remake and the Dead Space inspired Calisto Protocol came out. Was this a worry at all?

JZ: We were concerned at some moment. Nobody knew about Dead Space remake when we started our production. And on Callisto, we were very curious on various levels as a developer, also as gamers, like how it'll play If this is a spiritual successor of Dead Space. And it wasn't good in the case of gameplay.

So we could cool off, like, 'Okay, it's not new groundbreaking, survival horror, we can still have a shot.' And in case of Dead Space remake, it was just awesome to play it again and see how it's done and see how this can help us in our production. So definitely two interesting moments, but mostly we just learned something from it, more than be discouraged on our journey.

We don't think in categories like, 'Okay, people don't like Callisto or people don't like Dead Space Remake, so now we have a problem.' No, we are also doing something different than these two games.

IGN: As big fans of the genre, what excites you most about Cronos?

JZ: I think there are two things. One I can say, the second one... So the main character, the Traveler, who they are, what's happening, why they're doing this, the suit... We put a lot of effort into building it, to make it something special, make it something different. And the second part is this combat part. But it's a secret.

WP: I would say the same. I'm really happy how the Traveler looks, how we designed the suit. That was something that we really wanted from the very beginning, to not have a typical soldier type, but more a diver, a diver in time, and that's great. I saw a lot of comments like, 'Whoa, I love this suit, love this.' I know! Yes, yes, it's great. I'm so happy about it.

IGN: Horror games often make their protagonists rather faceless, but it sounds like you have big plans for yours and your story. Is that right?

WP: Yes, of course. Yeah. I know that we are making a third person game with the character in the helmet, but you still learn a lot about yourself and your place in the world. I know we are starting very big because like, oh, the word is destroyed and stuff, but yeah, please remember we are Bloober. We like to tell an intimate story about people and characters and this will not be different.

IGN: So with lots to it, do you think there is potential for more Cronos beyond The New Dawn?

WP: Definitely, definitely, definitely. Yeah, we've got plans for Cronos.

IGN: Now going down this independent route then, making your own franchise, is Bloober still open to making, for example, another Silent Hill remake or even a brand new Silent Hill game?

JZ: I think that's a very tough and open question. I think we are always open. If we like the opportunity, we'll take it.

WP: There are opportunities that you have to seize. Like Silent Hill 2, you can remake the legend. So yeah, I do believe that everything's possible. We are also fans of the genre. If the IP is interesting we probably will also be interested.

IGN: You mentioned earlier that the Silent Hill 2 remake has been criticizedfor all sorts since its announcement, but now it's released everyone loves it. Has that reception increased Bloober's confidence?

JZ: I think definitely, yes. It just gives all of us more confidence, I think definitely for the Silent Hill team, but also for us. Yeah, like 'We can do it. We can do that kind of crazy stuff.' We also love our previous games and some of them have better or worse reception, but still, we all put all our hearts into them and we also learn with each of them. So I think I'm only hyped to see how Cronos can land. And also what's further than Cronos.

WP: Long story short, I think we all feel that we leveled up as developers.

33,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Could Boost Game Pass by Up to 4 Million Subs — but at the Cost of 6 Million Lost Sales, Analysts Predict","Black Ops 6 comes out today, October 25, and it does something no other Call of duty game has done before: launch straight into Game Pass.

Following Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard, the pressure is now on its gaming business to deliver. With that in mind, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has decided to take the plunge and release Black Ops 6 as a day one Game Pass game, albeit restricted to the Ultimate and PC Game Pass tiers.

This is a momentous moment not just for Call of Duty but for Game Pass, which has struggled for growth in recent years. Latest official figures put Game Pass subscriber numbers at 34 million. That’s 34 million paying subscribers across console, PC, and cloud. Indeed Microsoft removed its $1 introductory Game Pass trial just weeks before Black Ops 6’s launch, as it did with last year’s Starfield — further evidence, after recent price hikes and tier changes, that the pressure is now on for Game Pass to make the absolute most of the power of Call of Duty.

Will it pay off for Microsoft? In interviews with GamesIndustry.biz, analysts predicted Black Ops 6 could boost Game Pass subscriber numbers by between 2.5 million and 4 million. However, analysts also predicted a significant impact on sales of Black Ops 6. Call of Duty is usually the best-selling game of the year, but there is now a big question mark over whether it will achieve that record once again with Black Ops 6 given it’s available as part of Game Pass.

Wedbush boss Michael Pachter told GI that putting Black Ops 6 into Game Pass could result in up to six million lost sales, based on the idea that 25% of Game Pass subscribers might have bought the game anyway. Countering this, Pachter said Game Pass could swell by between three to four million subscribers.

This is a perhaps expected shift, but is it overall better for Microsoft and Activision? The theory is that getting more players through the door than ever before, even at the cost of sales of the game, will eventually pay out because of Call of Duty’s lucrative live service, which is fueled by premium battle passes and costly cosmetic packs. Microsoft may be playing the long game here, even though it risks negative headlines about Call of Duty sales being down compared to previous years.

Of course, now Microsoft has taken the plunge with Call of Duty little is off the table when it comes to Game Pass. The expectation now is that each year’s premium Call of Duty game will launch day one on Game Pass, and fans are still waiting for the back catalog to be added.

We’ve got plenty more on Black Ops 6 ahead of launch, including its strange arachnophobia mode, built-in support for better audio tech that costs $20, Activision’s new ambitious plans to beat cheaters, and confirmation it doesn't include the dreaded Riot Shield.

34,Good Omens Season 3 No Longer Involves Neil Gaiman And Is Basically a Single 90-Minute Movie,"The David Tennant and Michael Sheen-starring Good Omens Season 3 will only consist of one, slightly longer episode as the Amazon Prime Video show moves forward without showrunner and creator Neil Gaiman.

Word on the drastically shorter third and final season comes from Variety, which says that Prime Video has confirmed Season 3 will be one 90-minute episode. That’s just 40 minutes longer than the average 50-minute episodes seen so far, with both of the first two seasons consisting of six episodes each. Production on the remainder of Good Omens is currently paused but is expected to pick back up in early 2025. It’s unclear when the final episode will release.

Good Omens Season 3 Reportedly One 90-Minute Episode.

Last month, Deadline reported that Gaiman, who is best known as author of projects such as The Sandman, Stardust, and Coraline, would be stepping back from work on Good Omens Season 3. The news arrived among allegations of sexual assault against the creator from multiple women. Now, Variety reports that Gaiman had helped write the finale episode but will not return to work on it when production resumes next year. He will also no longer be found as an executive producer in the credits for its final episode.

It’s a surprising ending for Good Omens following a strong run on Prime Video the last few years. The show was originally built to be a mini-series but was renewed for a second season following positive reception from fans (we gave Season 1 an 8/10 ). News of a continuation for the adaptation was a surprise to those familiar with the source material and Gaiman, who had originally suggested he didn’t want Season 2 to come to be .

How Good Omens Season 3 will wrap up the story with a single, movie-length episode remains to be seen. In the meantime, you can read our 7/10 review of Season 2. Then be sure to check out why we pinned the second season to be one of the biggest streaming series of 2023 .

35,Roblox Smash Hit Dress to Impress Pulls Hotdog Outfit After Players Used It to Look Like a Catwalking Penis,"The developers behind Roblox smash hit Dress to Impress have pulled a hotdog costume from the game after players used it to look like a penis.

Dress to Impress, from developer Gigi, launched inside Roblox in November last year and took the controversial user-generated content platform by storm. It tasks players with putting themed outfits on their avatars before they’re ranked.

Dress to Impress is meant to be a wholesome experience, but, as reported by Eurogamer, the recently added hotdog costume sparked less savory behavior. Players changed the color of the costume and combined it with a specific hat to make their fit look phallic. (For more, check out IGN’s Dress to Impress Halloween Update 2024 guide, which has all the details and patch notes.)

They done ruined up the hotdog for everyone @_Dress2Impress ? please fix this #DressToImpress pic.twitter.com/tpZ8T7RigL— slay bestie (@Numerou14390151) October 20, 2024

the hot dog costume was a mistake in the new dress to impress update pic.twitter.com/wrYlssPwPA— NATALiE JUPiTER ??? (@luvreignoerme) October 22, 2024

Dress to Impress development manager Zac initially took to X/Twitter to signal the removal of the hotdog costume’s colorable toggles, forcing players to use it as a plain hotdog costume. But Zac warned that if players continued to misuse the costume, it would be removed. “We want to create a safe and friendly environment for our players and it was not intended to be used this way,” Zac added.

Of course, players continued to misuse it, and so now the hotdog costume is no more. “Here’s the thing: we cannot simply change our whole UI system for a simple hotdog costume,” Zac explained.

“Creativity is the point of the game, and we see a lot of tweets that prove that. But, we just can’t give other outlets to something this serious. We love all of your creativity with it (besides the reasons we are removing it..) but it’s better for us and for the community just to end it asap.”

To that end, Dress to Impress’ hotdog costume is now replaced by a cupcake outfit. But even that has had to be changed as determined virtual penis-looking outfit fans changed the cupcake’s color to look like, well, you know. And so in response to that, the cupcake is non recolorable. Now that’s a happy ending.

after seeing plenty of comments, the cupcake will be non recolorable ?— zac (@studiozacc) October 22, 2024

Dress to Impress’ hotdog kerfuffle comes amid Roblox policy changes for pre-teen users that follow ongoing accusations of child-safety failures, which Roblox has denied. A 2023 class action lawsuit in California accused the Roblox Corporation of being misleading about ""the efficacy of its filtering technologies and its ability to make the site safe and appropriate for children."" A 2021 report by YouTube channel People Make Games alleged Roblox was exploiting child labor.

37,Where to Watch Every Friday the 13th Movie Online in 2024,"After the success of Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th kicked off the 80's by taking the slasher genre to gorey new heights. Jason Voorhees first appeared (sort of) to terrify teens at a Crystal Lake summer camp, and its safe to say the original Friday the 13th is essential viewing for any horror fan. 12 movies and 11 directors later, the hockey-mask wearing horror villain has become a zombie, gone to space, and battled a fellow slasher icon.

For those looking to watch or rewatch the films ahead of Halloween or the next Friday the 13th in December, here's where you can stream all of the Friday the 13th movies right now.

Where to Watch the Friday the 13th Movies Online

Over the years, the Friday the 13th movies have been pretty hard to find online. This October, the first eight Friday the 13th movies (""the original series,"" if you will) have finally found a home at Paramount+. The more recent films, including the 2009 reboot, are available to stream on Max. All of the Friday the 13th movies are available to rent or purchase from digital storefronts, which is unfortunately the only way to get your hands on Jason Goes to Hell (maybe that one's for the best) and Jason X.

Friday the 13th Movies on Blu-ray

While the Friday the 13th movies may be all over the place online, Shout!Factory released a collected set of all 12 movies on Blu-ray back in 2020. The set also includes what can only be described as a ludicrous amount of bonus features. If you don't need the Blu-ray or all those extras, you can also grab a DVD set of the first 8 movies for around $20.

What Order Should You Watch the Friday the 13th Movies

The Friday the 13th franchise, like most of the 80's slashers, has a lot going on. We're talking spin-offs, reboots, crossovers, and some good ol' time travel. For those interested in the Jason timeline, we've also covered how to watch the Friday the 13th movies in chronological order.

Will There Be More Friday the 13th Movies?

While the 2009 reboot may have intended to bring back the series, complicated legal drama over franchise rights has stalled the production of any new Friday the 13th movies since. Instead, the biggest release the franchise has seen in the past 15 years was Friday the 13th: The Game, which, due to more legal drama, was delisted at the end of 2023.

Still, we may finally get that 13th Friday the 13th movie. Earlier this year, Horror, Inc announced they would be working with some of the original license holders to build up a multi-platform Jason Universe. Yes, of course that's what they're calling it. While the Jason-verse will seemingly kick off with a Crystal Lake TV show, hopefully we see Jason back on the big screen sooner rather than later.

38,How to Watch Like a Dragon: Yakuza – Streaming Status and Release Schedule,"The loose TV adaptation of the long-running Yakuza game series is already here after being announced in June. As a fan, I was initially both stoked and skeptical hearing the news: The games are downright cinematic, but would the show be able to also capture the goofy humor and charm that also exist within the games, particularly in the side quests? Luckily, Ryu Ga Gotoko Studio was heavily involved in production and Ryoma Takeuchi, the actor playing Kazuma Kiryu, did not half-ass his preparations to inhabit the icon Kazuma Kiryu. Watching the trailer for the first time assuaged about 75% of my worries; even just going off the costuming of random yakuza guys wandering the streets, it's clear the series appears to Get It. You can read IGN's Like a Dragon: Yakuza review for more of our takes.

With the first three episodes just released, Yakuza heads won't have to wait any longer to find out how well the Amazon series stands on its own. Read on to find out more about how to stream the Like a Dragon: Yakuza TV show online now.

How to Watch Like a Dragon: Yakuza

Like a Dragon: Yakuza is streaming exclusively on Prime Video. You'll need a subscription for that; if you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial that gets access to all of the Amazon Prime benefits (free shipping, exclusive deals, free Grubhub+, etc.).

Like a Dragon: Yakuza Episode Release Schedule

The Yakuza series is six episodes total releasing in two parts: the first three on Thursday, October 24 and the other three on Thursday, October 31. Each episode runs around 40-45 minutes long.

How to Play the Yakuza/Like a Dragon Games

If you aren't already in the (unofficial) Yakuza Fan Club, but, after watching the series, you're thinkin' it's about time you joined, I have some great news: The nine (soon to be 10) mainline Yakuza/Like a Dragon games and spinoffs are available on most platforms. The only console that's a little light on Yakuza options is the Switch, which is getting a little love thrown its way. Yakuza Kiwami, the remake of the first Yakuza game, is also out on the Switch starting today.

What Is the Like a Dragon: Yakuza TV Show About?

The Yakuza TV show is specifically not trying to remake the game series on a story basis, going as far as discouraging the cast from playing the games at all. Instead, it's aiming more for an adaptation in vibes and spirit. Here's the official synopsis from Prime Video:

""This Japanese action drama plunges into the dark underworld of the yakuza, exploring the universal theme of family not only through bloodline but also through ties between yakuza bosses and their underlings, orphans and their caretakers, as well as mentors and students. These relationships are marked by deep affection at times, and by intense conflict at others, all intricately intertwined. Set in the fictional town of Kamurocho, the story unfolds across two intersecting timelines – 1995 and 2005.

""In 1995, eager to escape their restrictive lives, Kiryu and his friends, Nishiki, Yumi, and Miho plan a heist at a local arcade. However, the arcade is under the control of the Dojima Family, a powerful yakuza organization that rules Kamurocho. They dive into the yakuza-controlled underworld of 1995 Kamurocho. Meanwhile, in 2005, Kiryu is set to be released from prison. He learns from Detective Date that his friends are in danger and decides to return to Kamurocho to protect them. However, their friendship has deteriorated, as tensions between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance are at a boiling point.""

39,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Gets $30 Million Pay Raise Amid Year of Massive Gaming Layoffs,"The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, is getting a pay raise. A $30 million one.

According to a proxy filing published earlier this week and spotted by NBC, Nadella's compensation for the fiscal year 2024 totaled $79,106,183. $2.5 million of this was his base salary, $71.24 million was stock awards, $5.2 million was non-equity incentive plan compensation, and the rest was a mixture of other types of compensation.

This is significantly higher than last year, when Nadella's compensation totaled $48.5 million. While Nadella's base salary remained flat between years, he saw a massive jump in the past fiscal year in stock awards, going from $39.24 million last year to $71.24 million this year.

Nadella's compensation for the year was $79 million. Photo by Dimas Ardian/Bloomberg via Getty Images.

Per the filing, the ratio of total annual compensation of Nadella to the median employee at Microsoft was 408 to 1.

Notably, the filing points out that this number actually incorporates Nadella taking a pay cut. The ""cash incentive"" portion of his pay was reduced at Nadella's own request due to a security breach in 2023 where a Chinese espionage group hacked government email accounts through Microsoft. Per the filing, without this reduction, Nadella's non-equity incentive plan compensation would have totaled $10.66 million instead of $5.2 million.

""Since the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Nadella as the third Chief Executive Officer in its history in 2014, Microsoft has nearly tripled revenue to $245.1 billion, nearly quadrupled net income to $88.1 billion, and more than quadrupled diluted earnings per share to $11.80,"" the filing reads. ""In addition to another year of consistently strong financial performance, Mr. Nadella and his leadership team have positioned Microsoft to continue to drive performance for years to come.""

Microsoft's 2024 fiscal year took place from July of 2023 to June of 2024. During that period, the company acquired Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, a point that's celebrated in the Microsoft filing. However, the company also laid off 1,900 staff from its gaming workforce in early January. A few months later, it closed Redfall developer Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, and laid off others within Bethesda. And already this quarter, Microsoft has laid off another 650 gaming staff in a move which Xbox head Phil Spencer attributed directly to the acquisition.

Microsoft's first quarter earnings call for fiscal 2025 will take place next week, providing an update on the company as a whole as well as the gaming division. Microsoft has been doing well on the strength of Azure, Cloud, Office, and its other divisions, and the Activision Blizzard acquisition has provided it with a significant boost to gaming revenue. However, hardware sales have been dipping over the last year (a problem also faced by Xbox's rivals) and non-Activision Blizzard content sales have been relatively flat over the last year.

40,Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Adds Strange Arachnophobia Mode That Turns Zombie Spiders Into Floating Torsos,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is following a recent trend by adding an arachophobia setting to Zombies, but its solution somehow seems even worse.

As part of its blog detailing Black Ops 6's various acccessibility features, Activision showed off its new arachnophobia mode, explaining, ""For the first time in Black Ops 6 Zombies, a new arachnophobia toggle feature will be available. This setting will allow players to change the appearance of spider-like enemies in Zombies without affecting their game play.""

The description is accompanied by a screenshot that shows a spider beast crawling toward the player on one side, and what it looks like when the arachnophobia mode is turned on. It seems the toggle simply removes the spider creatures legs, turning it into a floating torso that resembles a flying leech with huge, spiky teeth. In a word, eww.

But hey, at least it's not a spider, right?

The new feature is part of Black Ops 6's version of Zombies, the latest in a long line of games dating back to Call of Duty: World at War. You can check out our full Zombies preview right here. Black Ops 6, meanwhile, releases October 25, but fans who use the New Zealand trick can gain access right now much earlier. Make sure to stay tuned for our full review.

41,From the Sonic Movies to Amazon’s Like a Dragon Drama Series: How Sega Is Bringing Its Games to the Screen,"Sega has found great success with its series of Sonic the Hedgehog movies – so much so that it has inspired the company to more actively pursue big- and small-screen adaptations of its treasure trove of game franchises. Next up is Like a Dragon: Yakuza, an Amazon Original series based on the first game in the beloved series, which launches on October 24 – and Sega has plans to do even more.

During Gamescom Asia, IGN Japan sat down with Justin Scarpone, Global Head of Transmedia at Sega, whose resume includes 17 years working with games and entertainment at Disney and who joined Sega in April 2024. From adaptations of Shinobi and Golden Axe to early forays into the theme park space, Scarpone gave us the lowdown on Sega’s plans to reach new audiences away from the game console.

“The Like a Dragon franchise is one of our core pillars,” Scarpone said when asked how the new series was conceived. “We released a live-action film years ago, but I think the new series came about originally through conversations between the Amazon Studios folks and our Like a Dragon studio, and it became a cross-Pacific project where you had talent in both the US and Japan working on the project. It’s obviously filmed in Japan, with Japanese talent, but leveraging some of the creativity that an overseas perspective brings. So it's a unique project for us.”

Streaming TV has been a great home for episodic dramas set in Japan, with Shogun breaking records in awards season and Tokyo Vice showing shocking sides of Japan’s (fictionalized) criminal underworld. Scarpone said the success of these shows has been encouraging as Amazon prepares to launch the new Like a Dragon series.

“Like a Dragon is a very Japanese story, but it's also very universal,” he said. “And one of the differences between the previous live-action film and this new drama being shown on Prime Video is that in the years since the film came out, the Like a Dragon series has become very much a global franchise. We have an international team who are considering from day one how to make a compelling story set in Japan with universal themes that resonate in different cultures.”

He says that the dev team at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have been supportive of the Prime Video show, which is partly based on the original game but will tell its own original story.

“(Masayoshi) Yokoyama has been quite supportive of this series,” said Scarpone. “As a truly creative individual, he's seeing a very interesting interpretation of the IP he lives and breathes, and he's very happy with the quality and the output. I think he's excited to see somebody else's perspective on it.”

We have an international team who are considering from day one how to make a compelling story set in Japan with universal themes.

The Like a Dragon game series has a setting that balances heavy crime suspsense drama with more humorous themes tied to gameplay. The Amazon show seems to be leaning more toward the former, but when condensing a game with a storyline that is dozens of hours long into a TV show, it must be difficult to choose which elements to embrace and which ones to leave out.

“In the format of a series where you have about five hours of storytelling, how can you tell a compelling, exciting, dramatic and concise story?” Scarpone pondered. “Some of the games in the series you could play for over 80 hours, which gives you a lot more flexibility to weave in other aspects of the characters than you have in a condensed, linear format. So I think the director, the actors and the screenwriters of the Amazon show needed to make a judgment call on how to tell the best story within the confines of that time.

“The game series evolved over time, so if this Amazon series were to have a sequel, I think we could also experiment. The series hopefully will be a good starting point in that format, and maybe there'll be more in the future.”

Sega's Sonic renaissance

Sega has had huge success with the live-action outings for its mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog. Since 2020, Paramount Pictures has released two hit movies and a TV spinoff, with a third movie landing in December and adding Keanu Reeves to its voice cast.

“We have seemingly come to think of this period of the last decade or so as the renaissance of Sonic,” Scarpone told us. “There were a lot of stops and starts to try to bring Sonic to the silver screen – it didn't happen overnight. But once we were locked in and working on the first film, that was really Sega’s entry point into transmedia, and thinking of Sonic as a franchise, and the way companies like Disney and Universal and Warner Brothers have always done it for decades.

“We're offering new stories and new ways to experience the characters in different media. And so with Sonic, the film really expanded what Sonic could be in the eyes of the fans – and probably a lot of people inside of Sega as well.”

Indeed, in an interview with IGN in 2022, Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto told us the success of the Sonic movies had inspired him and Sonic Team while making the games.

Sega also has multiple other screen adaptations of its games in the pipeline, including versions of series that have been dormant for decades. One is Shinobi, which has both a game and a live-action adaptation in the works. The film is being produced together with Universal, which made the smash-hit Super Mario Bros. Movie, and directed by Sam Hargrave. Scarpone confirmed to us it is still in the “early stage” of development.

As we reboot some of these franchises, it's important for us to really work on the story, to update it for younger generations.

Classic series Golden Axe is also coming back, both as a game and as an animated series for Comedy Central. A Streets of Rage movie has also been announced, with a script by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad.

Of these adaptations of older Sega franchises, Scarpone said, “Our core pillars are franchises like Sonic, Like a Dragon, Persona and Angry Birds, but our so-called Legacy Initiative is really exciting because, while these stories have a foundation, we have a lot more new storytelling to work on, which is really cool. As we reboot some of these franchises, it's important for us to really work on the story, work on the lore, to update it for younger generations who weren't even alive when the Sega Genesis was around.”

Scarpone also confirmed that Sega has multiple other screen adaptations in the early stages of development, but would not share which games these unannounced projects are based on just yet.

And it doesn’t stop at screen adaptations. In recent years, Nintendo has had great success with its theme parks at Univeral Studios, while other games such as Monster Hunter and Resident Evil have been reimagined as excellent theme park attractions in Japan. Sega is an old hand in this business, with its Joypolis and other entertainment centres. Scarpone said Sega is keen to expand on this, offering the example of its upcoming collaboration with the Kai Tak Sports Park mall currently under construction in Hong Kong.

“Within that complex, we're going to have Sonic Stadium, which is a destination for families and children in particular, as a ticketed area where you can be immersed in the world of Green Hills and Sonic and friends.

“What Nintendo has done with Universal Studios is the gold standard, and we have similar aspirations. Attractions are another format to tell our stories and delight our fans, and we really want to be in that space. We’re not launching our own standalone theme park, but we are looking into different partnerships.”",2024-10-24 13:00:00+00:00,Daniel Robson
42,Silent Hill 2 Remake Hotfix Addresses Progress Breaking Bug,"Bloober Team has released a patch for the Silent Hill 2 remake which brings the game to Version 1.05 and fixes a progress breaking bug.

The patch notes were released on Steam and focus predominantly on the issue introduced in Version 1.04, which stopped some players progressing past the Labyrinth section of the survival horror game.

""We are happy to announce a new update for Silent Hill 2 that addresses a critical issue in the Labyrinth level, after Patch 1.04 for both Steam and PlayStation 5 players, and introduces Steam Cloud save functionality for PC players on Steam,"" Bloober Team said. The full patch notes are available below.

Bloober Team said it was aware of the issue on October 22 when the bug was discovered. Several Silent Hill 2 players shared their frustration online as the Labyrinth section began living up to its name a little too well, trapping players inside its walls forever.

This section is a giant puzzle, as players must manipulate a cube to shift the walls around and open new pathways to progress. But after Patch 1.04 was released, some pathways wouldn't open at all. This has now been fixed, however.

Bloober Team and publisher Konami released the Silent Hill 2 remake on October 8 to glowing critical reception and strong sales, leaving many fans of the previously dormant horror franchise eager for more.

Bloober has said it's open to making other Silent Hill games, though at the moment is focused on its sci-fi survival horror game Cronos: The New Dawn.

In our 8/10 review of the Silent Hill 2 remake, IGN said: ""Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror.""

Silent Hill 2 Remake Version 1.05 Patch Notes

Fixes

Labyrinth Progression Blocker: Fixed an issue where players who saved their game in the Labyrinth, after Toluca Prison, on the previous version encountered a progression blocker if the save data was loaded after updating to Patch 1.04. We have implemented a fix by adding a safeguard that forces proper activation of the necessary triggers, ensuring smooth progression moving forward. Features

Steam Cloud Saves: We have enabled Steam Cloud support for PC players on Steam. Please note that the game will automatically sync with the latest cloud save data. If the cloud save is more recent than the local save, it will overwrite the local data without a warning pop-up. We recommend players back up their local saves if you wish to keep multiple versions.

43,Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Isn’t Properly Out Yet but One Streamer Already Has a Gold Camo,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is rolling out across the world (in New Zealand first, as is Call of Duty tradition), and fans are already getting stuck into the shooter’s annual camo grind. For one Call of Duty streamer the race is on for world firsts — with one in the bag already.

Call of Duty Twitch streamer Reidboyy, who IGN has reported on in the past for unlocking Modern Warfare 3’s most coveted camo after a near 76-hour grind, took just over an hour to obtain the gold camo for the XM4, and took to X/Twitter to declare the world first.

FIRST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO HAVE GOLD CAMO IN #BlackOps6



GOLD XM4 ✅ pic.twitter.com/WWJVkvmLV4— Reidboyy (@Reidboy24) October 24, 2024

Black Ops 6 has four Mastery Camos to be earned in each mode (Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone). The camo in question is the Gold Multiplayer Mastery Camo. This Tier 1 Mastery Camo is unlocked by earning all nine Military Camos and two Special Camos in the corresponding mode, and then completing the applicable Camo Challenge. It’s incredibly impressive that Reidboyy was able to achieve this in just an hour.

Reidboyy has said his target is to unlock all of Black Ops 6’s camos by the end of this weekend. If he hasn’t managed it by midnight Sunday, October 27, he’ll consider his grind an “L.” A ""W,"" then, would mean getting all Black Ops 6's coveted Dark Matter camos in Multiplayer.

One Black Ops 6 player has already unlocked a gold camo in Multiplayer. Image credit: Activision Publishing.

For the record, here’s everything involved in getting Dark Matter camo in Black Ops 6, per Activision:

Access by earning Mastery Camo Tier 2 for the designated number of Weapons across multiple Weapon Classes in the corresponding mode, and then complete the applicable Camo Challenge. For example, a Multiplayer player must earn Dark Spine Camo on 33 Weapons (the number of launch Weapons in Black Ops 6) before they gain access to the Dark Matter Camo Challenge on those Weapons.

Just like Military Camos, Mastery Camos must be unlocked individually with each Weapon and once unlocked can only be used with that Weapon. For example, if you’ve unlocked Gold Camo for the AMES 85, it can be equipped to the AMES 85 anywhere you use it, but not to any other weapon until you’ve separately unlocked Gold with that weapon.

As mentioned, Black Ops 6 is rolling out now globally, although players across the world are using Call of Duty’s infamous New Zealand trick to access the game earlier than their timezone officially allows.

44,Graphic Samurai: The Art of Denys Cowan Celebrates a Comic Book Legend,"Denys Cowan has certainly enjoyed an illustrious career as a comic book creator, including legendary runs on books like The Question and Deathlok and serving as one of the co-founders of Milestone Media. Now publisher Gizmoe Press is celebrating that career with a new retrospective artbook called Graphic Samurai: The Art of Denys Cowan.

Head down to the slideshow gallery below to see several pages featured in Graphic Samurai, including Cowan's work on Batman and his iconic John Wick: Chapter 2 movie poster:

Graphic Samurai spotlights Cowan's entire comic book career at DC, Marvel, Milestone, and elsewhere, including franchises like Batman, The Question, Black Panther, and Deathlok and Milestone creations like Hardware, Icon, Rocket, and Static.

“I'm happy to share a personal selection of the different and exciting projects I've had the opportunity to work on and have it presented in a high-quality hardcover collection,"" Cowan said in a statement. ""It was fun to revisit the different eras of my career and chart my evolution as an artist, a creator and a storyteller. Now I'm even more inspired!”

“Denys’ long career is unique in the comic book industry and more than worthy of examination,” said author and Gizmoe co-founder Michael Stradford. “His story is inspiring and relatable to those with creative aspirations regardless of the area of interest. We're excited and honored that he chose Gizmoe to tell his story. And the art looks good too!”

Graphic Samurai: The Art of Denys Cowan is currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter, which the book due for release in 2025.

45,Free for All Is the New Comic From One of 2024's Best New Creators,"Patrick Horvath's Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees is undoubtedly one of the most memorable comics of 2024. How often do you see a cutesy, cartoonish bear moonlighting as a sadistic serial killer? Now IGN can exclusively reveal Horvath's next project, an equally kooky graphic novella called Free for All.

Check out the slideshow gallery below to see several pages from Free for All #1:

Published by Oni Press and written and drawn by Horvath, Free for All is set in a world where billionaires and trillionaires face a gruesome choice. They can either donate half of their money to charity, or they can defend their fortunes through combat in the gladiator arena. Ted Brooks is the reigning champion of the World Finance League, but he faces the ultimate test when his vindictive ex-wife Luella challenges him. Who will walk away with the money in this winner-takes-all showdown?

“I’m thrilled that Free for All has found a home with Oni Press,” said Horvath in a statement. “The idea for it came from an immense frustration with the state of society almost a decade ago, and with the issues of the world as they stand now, it’s only become more relevant. I’m so glad this book has a chance now to reach a wide audience.”

“With Beneath the Trees, Patrick Horvath has proven himself to be the rare breed of creator who can show up entirely fully formed with their debut work, while simultaneously presenting an entirely new point of view – in this case, one that that is enthralling and entertaining as it is disturbing and confrontational. Free for All has all of those same qualities in spades – including Horvath’s signature vivisection-rich violence and correspondingly pernicious sense of humor – with a dystopian science-fiction edge that one-part cultural commentary, one-part battle royale,” said Oni Press President & Publisher Hunter Gorinson. “It’s an honor for Oni to publish the next work in the growing library of titles from such an immense talent, and there’s little doubt that readers will be dueling to get their hands on it this March.”

Free for All #1 is priced at $7.99 and will be released in March 2025. It's one of several upcoming 2025 titles Oni will be revealing in the weeks ahead.
